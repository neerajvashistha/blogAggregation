It’s also a great way for an entrepreneur or small business to have fun, create value and make money. Good business development allows businesses to profit by doing something that is tangential to their core mission. Sometimes the profit is so good, it becomes part of their core mission, other times it supports the brand and sometimes it just makes money. And often it’s a little guy who can be flexible enough to make things happen. Examples: Starbucks licenses their name to a  maker  of ice cream and generates millions in royalties. A rack jobber like  Handleman  does a deal with a mass marketer like K Mart. K Mart gives them room in the store to sell records and gets a cut, Handleman does all the work. AOL buys AIM instant messaging software and integrates it into their service. Years ago, I licensed the rights to Isaac Asimov’s  Robot  novels from a business development person at his publisher and turned the books into a VCR murder mystery game which I licensed to a business development person at Kodak, a company that was experimenting with becoming a publisher. (Isaac made more from this project than he did from many of his books). Best Buy offers extended warranties on appliances you buy. They don’t provide the warranty, of course, a business development person did a deal with an insurance/service company to do it and they share the profit. The Princeton Review built a huge test prep business, but only by licensing their brand to a series of books which did the lion’s share of their marketing for them. You don’t see business development from the outside, particularly all the potential deals that fail along the way. Many companies, though, spend millions of dollars a year looking for deals and then discovering that they pay off many times over. Others, particularly smaller competitors, are so focused on their core business that it never occurs to them to consider partnerships, licensing, publishing, acquisition and other arrangements that might change everything. Harley Davidson probably makes more money on business development than they make on motorcycles. The thing that makes business development fascinating is that  the best deals have never been done before.  There’s no template, no cookie cutter grind it out approach to making it work. This is why most organizations are so astonishingly bad at it. They don’t have the confidence to make decisions or believe they have the ability to make mistakes. Think about the  Apple Nike  partnership on making a device that integrates your iPod with your sneakers. This took years and cost millions of dollars to develop. Most companies would just flee, giving up long before a deal was done and a product was shipped. Here are some tactical tips on how to do business development better: Process first, ideas second . If you’re going to be bringing new partners and new ideas into your organization, you need a process to do it. Professionals don’t, “know it when I see it.” Instead, professionals think about the abilities of their company and strategies necessary to bring ideas in, refine them and launch them. Great business development people don’t waste time in endless meetings with random vendors or hassle about tiny details up front. Instead, they have an agenda and a project manager’s understanding of what it means to get things done. They don’t keep the process a secret, either. They share it with anyone who wants to know. Someone needs to say, “here’s how we do things around here,” and then they have to tell the truth. Who decides?  Because every great business development project is different, it’s incredibly easy to get stuck on who can say  yes  (of course, everyone can say  no ). Professional business development people intentionally limit the number of people who are allowed to weigh in and are clear to themselves and their potential partners about exactly who can (and must) give the go ahead. Don’t bother starting a business development deal unless you know in advance who must say yes. Courtship, negotiation and marriage . Every deal has three parts, and keeping them straight is essential. During the courtship phase, you win when you are respectful, diligent, enthusiastic, engaging, outgoing, and relentless in your search to make a connection. Do your homework, research people’s backgrounds, learn about their kids, visit them–don’t make them visit you. Look people in the eye, ask hard but engaging questions, you know the drill. Basically, treat people as you’d like to be treated, because the people you most want to work with have a choice, and they may just not pick you. Hint: if you skip the courtship part, the other two stages probably won’t come up. Buyer and seller.  If you’ve ever pitched a product or service to a business, you know how soul-deadening it can be. The buyer works hard to make it clear that she’s doing you a favor, and you need every dog and every pony available at all times (and you better be the cheapest). But business development doesn’t have this dichotomy. Both sides are buying, both sides are selling, right? So talented business development people never act like jaded buyers, arms folded, demanding this and that. Instead, from the start, they seek out partners. Enthusiasm is underrated.  Business development people are exploring the unknown. That means that there’s more than cash on the table, there’s bravery and initiative and excitement. The best business development people I’ve ever worked with are able to capture the energy in the room and amplify it. They’ll build on the ideas being presented, not make them smaller. Close the open door.  I regularly hear from readers who are frustrated because a big company wasn’t willing to hear a great idea they mailed in. Here’s the thing: there isn’t a shortage of ideas. There’s a shortage of execution. That means that successful business development teams look for proven partners and organizations with momentum. A key part of that is the decision to say no early and quickly and respectfully to people who don’t meet that threshold. Call the lawyers later.  A business development deal that never happens is one that’s sure to cause no problems. While the legal clarity you need is important, there’s plenty of data that shows that ten page NDA agreements and onerous contracts early in the process don’t protect you, they merely waste your time and energy. Cast a wider net.  The  Allen and Co.  annual gathering is a dumb place to choose a merger partner. Limiting the number of potential partners to people you’ve met at a trade show is also silly. Business development (when it works) creates huge value for both sides, so better to be proactive in searching out and soliciting the organizations that can make a difference. Here’s a simple way to widen your net: start a blog and go to conferences to speak. Describe your successful business development projects to date and let the world know you’re looking for more of them. How many amazing partnerships could the Apple store launch? How many great books could Starbucks highlight? Not only don’t they do this, they hide. Don’t hide. Talk to the receptionist.  This is huge, and so important. When a great partner shows up at your doorstep, do you know? Here’s a test: call your organization (pretending to be from some respected organization), describe a business development opportunity and ask who can help. If you’re not immediately transferred to your office, you’ve failed, right? Make it easy for the right people to know that you’re the right guy. Hire better.  How do you decide who to put in this job? I’d argue that glibness and charisma aren’t as important as strategic thinking, project management and humility. Structure deals with the expectation of success.  The only real reason to do business development deals is because when they work they’re so powerful. Andrew Tobias put his name on a piece of software that ended up earning him millions of dollars. It’s easy to get hung up on all the bad things that could happen, but keep your focus on how the world looks when you get it right. End well.  Most of the time, even good business development deals fall down before the end of the negotiation process. If a deal doesn’t come together, say so. Acknowledge what went wrong, thank the other party and end well. If it does come together, track the integration and stay involved enough to learn from what works and what doesn’t. I’m still waiting to hear from people who said they’d get back to me “tomorrow” fifteen years ago, but I’m losing hope… Ending well not only teaches you how to do better next time, but it keeps doors open for when you need to come back to someone who you should have done a deal with in the first place.

 Guest Post ,  Putting Capital to Work     5 Low-Cost Marketing Research Techniques for Small Businesses			     
 Big companies spend millions of dollars on TV ads, national surveys, and focus groups in order to connect with customers and better understand their needs. For successful businesses, it’s a necessary investment. Doing  marketing  research is one of the first actions you need to take before launching a start-up. Skipping it is like walking through a minefield blindfolded. 
 Unfortunately, not everyone can afford expensive marketing research. However, small business owners have a great advantage over the giants: they’re closer to their customers. That translates into more accessible ways of conducting research by taking advantage of a few easy and affordable options. 
 Here are five low-cost and extremely efficient marketing research techniques that will allow you to validate your product idea and attract more customers. 
 1.   Question Yourself First 
 If you haven’t done this already, you’ve neglected the most important part of the process. Before even thinking of getting your idea out there, you have to create an estimate of how your business will perform early on, and set some realistic business goals. Here are few questions you have to address yourself first: 
 
 How much money do I plan to earn each year/month off of my product/service? 
 What are the costs of the initial startup, and what are the costs of the maintenance? 
 How much do I need to sell in order to reach my financial goal? 
 
 These three preliminary questions will help you understand how much effort you need to put into your business, whether or not you’re on track, and how well defined your idea is before you go to market. 
 2.  Directly Interview Your Potential Customers 
 Direct interaction is king, and what better way of performing it other than directly contacting potential prospects and customers? Find out who they are, how you can reach them, and then just do it. Here are some good questions that you should prepare before starting that conversation: 
 
 What is the most valuable aspect of your product? 
 What alternatives do they have, and why would they choose it instead of your product? 
 Why would they choose your product instead of others? 
 What events or personal issues would make them instantly buy your product? 
 How much are they willing to pay? 
 Where is the place they’d go first when looking for a product such as yours? 
 
 You can add new questions, or even remove some of the above. The main target here is to discover and then analyze the people who will eventually buy from you. The more information you can get from them, the better off your new business will be. 
 3.  Set Up Online Surveys 
 An even easier way of finding out valuable answers from your potential customers is to set up surveys. There are thousands of companies online — free or paid — that will allow you to fine-tune your product idea with the help of the public. 
 If you don’t have a  customer database  yet, you can use social media when trying to reach a specific audience. Facebook for example has an amazing targeting feature that will allow you to place your surveys into the hands of the right people. 
 Here’s a quick tip. If you are serious about conducting a marketing research campaign, you need to invest few bucks into proofreading your surveys and content.  Assignment Masters  is the best solution because it’s an extremely affordable and qualitative service. 
 4.  Leverage Marketing Professors and Students 
 This strategy is extremely useful and most of the times cost-free. You basically seek marketing professors from universities in your local town and ask them for help. They will be extremely happy to let their students get practical experience while working on your business’s research. 
 Young and motivated students are often willing to work harder for you than a paid service/consultant would. Furthermore, the students are going to be advised by the professor throughout the process, so the marketing research will overseen by an expert and as efficient as it can be. Win-win. 
 5.  Join Online Communities 
 There are tons of blogs, live chats, and forums that everyone with an internet connection can access. Start by compiling a list of all the online destinations where your potential customers spend their time. After you have your list, begin creating a profile for yourself or your company on each of them and start engaging. 
 This can be a very time consuming process, but a price needs to be paid — either your money, or your time. Engaging with potential customers online is a free method, and can be used by almost any type of business. 
 Small companies should never underestimate the power of the free tools that are available to them. Remember, small businesses can become  great companies  in time, and there are hundreds of examples that prove this. Go out there and make it happen!

Are Product Managers the New Software Engineers?,https://hired.com/blog/highlights/product-managers-new-software-engineers/,"Are Product Managers the New Software Engineers? Company News | Hired Blog Network     Hired - Company News Company News Candidates       How It Works       FAQ       Blog       Employers       How It Works       FAQ       Blog       Invite   Sign In   Sign Up     Are Product Managers the New Software Engineers? by Whitney Ricketts     Are Product Managers the New Software Engineers?                               February 09, 2017 Reports Software engineers have long been the vaunted kings of Silicon Valley, but a new power nexus is rapidly emerging: Product management. Now the highest paid role in technology in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia, the meteoric rise of product management mirrors that of software developers in the 1990s — not just in monetary terms, but also in terms of cultural clout and ‘unicorn’-like scarcity. Are product managers the new software developers? All signs point to a resounding yes — as it relates to the scarcity of  good  PMs with the experience or skills needed to scale a product. Here are some key corollaries we’re seeing between the market for product managers now and the market for software engineers historically: Higher demand is driving higher salaries, with no signs of stopping. Per  Hired’s 2017 Global State of Tech Salaries,  Product managers bring in the highest average salary offers of any tech role. In 2016,  product managers saw a 5.9 percent increase in US salaries to an average of $138k, and 1.6 percent in the UK to an average of £64k0 ($84k). . While UK salaries are lower across the board, product managers are still coming out on top at $83K (£64K) on average in 2016. Good PMs merge technical skills with marketing acumen. We analyzed more than 280,000 interview requests and job offers from the past year to identify the most in-demand PM skills, and the top 6 skills (see right-side image) reflect the cross-functional, full-stack nature of the PM function. “Good product managers are good marketers,  explains Twitter product lead Hernal Shah . “They know their target audience and the best ways to reach them. They design their product for distribution.” In a prescient 2005 comment on Ken Norton’s now-infamous  How to Hire a Product Manager , PM-turned-Greylock-VC Josh Elman (then a PM lead at LinkedIn) wrote: “[Product management] one of the most difficult jobs to measure — not in lines of code, press releases, ad sales, etc. The hardest (and most exciting) part of the job is being responsible for answering and understanding the why… “Why do users need this?” “Why is this going to support the business?” “Why can’t we get this done faster?” “Why should it work *this* way?” Mature markets have raised the stakes. Product adoption is increasingly key to company success; it’s not just about shipping quality code anymore. With software eating the world, all industries are anchored in technology — and must think like one to secure (and keep) market leadership. Plus, according to Deloitte & Touche, customer-centric companies are 60% more profitable than their peers. “It’s not just about shipping software, explains Matt LeMay in  The Past and Future of Product Management . “As venture capital becomes more interested in companies that are revenue-focused and truly understand their market, there is an appreciable shift away from ‘just ship software’ and towards ‘ship the right software.’ It’s  hard  to hire good product managers. Depending on who you ask, finding and hiring good  product managers  is now a more challenging endeavor than finding and hiring good software engineers. Why is this? “ Hiring developers is by no means easy, but mastery of technical systems is ultimately easier to display and quantify than mastery of human systems (if the latter is even possible),” explains Matt LeMay in  The Past and Future of Product Management . “As more companies acknowledge the importance of product management, there is also a growing sense of anxiety and confusion around what makes a “good” product manager and how to find them.” There’s no clear rubric for evaluating PM talent. Due to a wildly varying understanding as to what  product managers  actually do, there’s no clear industry framework for evaluating how good any PM is at their job. “Right now, being ‘good’ at Product isn’t about skills,” writes Lola VP of Product  Ellen Chisa . “It’s about if someone will give you a chance.” Absent of a shared understanding of how to grade PM candidates, hiring managers judge candidates based on where they’ve worked (which is problematic for both parties, and often results in homogenous teams). The PM CEO has replaced the programmer CEO. In the same way the 90s was the decade that minted hacker CEOs, we are now witnessing the era of the PM CEO. Technical idols like Bill Gates and Steve Wozniak of the 90s have since been replaced by a legion of CEOs who cut their teeth on product teams (Yahoo’s Marissa Mayer, Slack’s Stewart Butterfield, Google’s Sundar Pichai, Drift’s David Cancel, Fog Creek Software’s Anil Dash, and more). What’s driving this PM flooding of the C-suite?  “Because a PM has a disproportionate impact on setting strategy and deciding what work actually gets done, she is the key to success or failure,” writes David Auerbach in his masterful  The Age of the Product Manager . As markets mature,  the stakes are higher, market leadership is no longer secure just by being first; the product has to earn it. “Though it’s easier to start a company than ever before, it’s harder to compete,”  Medium’s Ev Williams laments .

 Once you’ve  gathered all of the competitive data  you have been able to locate, it’s analysis time. You should analyze to determine product information, market share, marketing strategies, and to identify your competition’s strengths and weaknesses.

 Product Evaluation 
 You should know from your sales staff and customer feedback what product features and benefits are most important to your customers and potential customers. A product’s or service’s competitive position is largely determined by how well it is differentiated from its competition and by its price. 
 Here's how to go about a product evaluation: 
   
 Start with a List 
 Start by making a list of product features and benefits in order of importance, and prepare a table to show whether or not each of your competitors fulfill them. 
 
 
 
 Indicate with a check mark which of your competitors has which features and benefits. Features are fairly straightforward, either a product has it or it doesn’t. Benefits, on the other hand, are not as simple and should only be recorded based on customer feedback. 
 
 
 Now, use this table to evaluate your competition’s product or service. 
 
 
 
 How does your product compare to your closest competitor’s? 
 
 
 What features and benefits are unique to your product? To theirs? 
 
 
 
 The more unique features and benefits your product has, the stronger your market position will be. 
 
 
 
 
 Compare Prices 
 Evaluate your competitor’s price. If your price for a similar product is higher than your competitor’s, then your market position is weaker; and if it’s lower, then your competitive position is better. As a side note: look for trends in pricing rather than momentary rises and falls. 
   
 Other Factors to Consider 
 Customer preference of products is only part of the analysis. Some other factors to consider: 
 
 Financial resources — Are they able to withstand financial setbacks? How are they funding new product development and improvement? 
 Operational efficiencies — Are they able to save time and cost with clever production and delivery techniques? 
 Product line breadth — How easily can they increase revenues by selling related products? 
 Strategic partnerships — What kinds of relationships do they have with other companies in terms of product development, promotion or add-on sales? 
 Company morale/personnel — What is the motivation, commitment and productivity level of the employees? 
 
   
 
 Market Share 
 The most widely used measure of sales performance is market share. A competitor may not provide the best product or service; however, if they generate a significant amount of sales to the market, they may: 
 
 
 Define the standards for a particular product or service. 
 
 
 Influence the popular perception of the product or service. 
 
 
 Devote resources to maintaining their market share. 
 
 
 To determine your company’s market share on a percentage basis, the following formula should be used: 
  Current Market Share = Company sales / Industry sales 
 You should then compute each of your competitors’ market shares. 
   
   
 Competitive Objectives and Strategies 
 For each competitor in your analysis, you should try to identify what their market objectives are and determine what types of strategies they are using to achieve them. 
   
 Objectives 
 Are your competitors trying: 
 
 
 To maintain or increase market share? 
 
 
 To maximize short-term or long-term profits? 
 
 
 To introduce technologically improved products into your market? 
 
 
 To establish themselves as the market leaders? 
 
 
 To protect their market share under attack by strong competition? 
 
 
 To develop new markets for existing products? 
 
 
 
 Strategies 
 Once you have identified what your competitors are trying to achieve, you will need to determine what type of strategy they have employed so you can eventually counteract with a strategy of your own. Some possible strategies your competitor’s may be employing are: 
 
 
 Reducing their prices. 
 
 
 Advertising in new publications, or advertising more frequently. 
 
 
 Buying out a competitor to increase market share and customer base. 
 
 
 Improving a product with a new innovation. 
 
 
   
   
 Identify the Competitions Strengths and Weaknesses 
 In order to develop effective competitive strategies, you need to make a realistic assessment of your competitors’ strengths and weaknesses, as viewed by the market. 
 You need to ask yourself what each of your competitors do very well, better than your own company? Then, ask yourself in what areas are each of your competitors weak. You should construct a simple chart that summarizes this information. 
   
 No matter what your market position may be, you need a strong online lead generation strategy. Get your free [guide] Introduction to Lead Generation now. 
   
 Determine Your Competitive Position in the Marketplace 
 By now it should be fairly clear to you if you are a: market leader, one of several followers, or new to your marketplace. Once you have identified and analyzed your competition, and understand your competitive position, you are ready to do the following: 
 
 
 Identify and discuss key areas of competitive advantage and disadvantage. Review the competitive environment for your product or service. Comment on both similar and substitute products or services. 
 
 
 Summarize the major problems and opportunities facing your firm which may require action. Issues which should be considered include types of market penetration, distribution coverage, product line needs, price revisions and/or cost reductions. 
 
 
 Integrate your analysis of the competition with demographic analysis of your market to develop and implement a marketing strategy that will strengthen your market position. 
 
 
   
   
 What Means are Available to Limit and Control the Competition? 
 Now that you understand your position, how can you limit and control your competition? 
 To start, marketers of different brands of products will often pursue a particular market segment. Segmentation allows you to focus attempts to limit and control the competition on a smaller target. There are however, a broad range of strategies a business can employ in a competitive environment — from price changing and new packaging to improving customer service and new product development. 
 We also suggest implementing a strong online lead generation strategy. To get started with lead generation today read the free comprehensive  Introduction to Lead Generation Guide.

 Marketing’s not a technical field, right? 
 Think again.  As growth hacking has proven repeatedly over the last few years, a data-driven approach to marketing achieves stronger, more reliable results than traditional marketing. 
 The mad men of the future will combine  creativity  with  rigorous analysis . ( tweet this ) 
 Despite a plethora of outstanding tools that handle much of the analysis, the best marketers will understand enough statistics to explore deeper insights from Google Analytics, enough SQL to access product usage logs without waiting for IT to build a special interface, and enough programming to effectively communicate requests to engineering. 
 Learning these seven technical skills will help you grow your product faster and more effectively. 
 1. Statistics 
  Much of the effectiveness of growth hacking comes from its data-driven approach to marketing. As such, a basic knowledge of statistics will help any growth marketer become more effective. 
 Now, this doesn’t mean you need to go back to school and major in applied stats, but it does mean that investing a few hours a week learning basic statistics could be worth the time. 
 To run a/b tests well, you should at least understand the basics of confidence intervals and significance. To forecast growth patterns, you should at least understand regression- and smoothing-based models (plus  data visualization ). To mine insights with SQL, you should at least understand basic statistics and logical structuring. 
 Resources For Learning:

 ALEKS  (my personal favorite) 
 
 Challenge Project: Predict Crime 
 Use  publicly available data  for your city to create a predictive algorithm ( check for your city here ).  Based on all the historical records, build an algorithm to predict crime by type and location (probably zip code).  To check for accuracy, you could build the algorithm off of data up to 12 months ago, then test it’s accuracy in predicting this past year’s activity. 
 For an easier project, you could use that same data to create a safety rating for each part of your city - perhaps visualizing it in a map. ( like this map modeling energy use in NYC ) 
 2. Programming 
  While you  shouldn’t necessarily become a programmer , all growth marketers  should learn the basics of coding . It will help you build small things yourself (like a/b tests) and let you communicate more effectively with your company’s engineering teams. 
 In general, you should master HTML/CSS and have some familiarity with these web languages: 
 
 Ruby on Rails 
 PHP 
 Python 
 
 Remember, you don’t need to become an expert programmer who can rebuild Pandora from scratch - you just need to know enough to read code that’s already written and possibly make a few small modifications. 
 For instance, I’m certainly far from a PHP master or even novice, but I do know enough that I can generally find the right code to add or delete within my Wordpress theme files. 
 Resources For Learning: 
 
 Code School 
 Treehouse 
 W3Schools 
 
 Challenge Project: Build A Personal Website 
 Particularly for people working in digital marketing, personal branding though a portfolio website will supercharge your career. You don’t need some super complicated website or even a blog, but you should have some central place people can visit to learn more about you ( example  and  example ). 
 Using Wordpress as your website framework, use coding (HTML, CSS, and PHP) to customize your website’s look and feel.  Depending how ambitious you’re feeling, you can start with either a free or paid theme, then learn as you go until you like the way your website looks.  Wordpress is a great framework to use for this because the Wordpress support community is massive. When you hit snags in your coding, the solution is probably just a search away. 
 3. Excel Modeling 
  Big data. Everyone wants big data, but no one knows what to do with it.  The elephant in the room, of course, is that big data is absolutely useless by itself. 
 To be useful,  big data must lead to big insights . ( tweet this ) 
 And that’s where Excel modeling comes in.  Once you have data about how your customers use your service, you should be able to throw that into a pivot table and uncover interesting insights. Perhaps customers who downloaded ebook 2 are twice as likely to join as those who downloaded ebook 1.  Perhaps people who got both are even more likely.  You’ll never know unless you can turn the raw data into key learnings. 
 Happily, you can learn enough Excel to be dangerous pretty quickly by focusing on three key elements: formulas, pivot tables, and macros.  Keyboard shortcuts  will also come in handy.

 Challenge Project: Mutant Cell Growth 
 Your neighbor, a top-secret experimental scientist, has noticed a disturbing number of mutant cells in his lab.  Knowing you’re a data ninja, he asked you to forecast mutant cell growth. 
 Your scientist friend currently has a total of 100,000 cells in his lab and 1% are mutant.  Every day, each cell replicates - producing 15 normal cells and 1 mutant cell.  Survival rate is low, though, and only 1 out of each 16 new cells randomly survives. 
 At the end of 10 days, how many (1) normal cells, (2) clones of original mutants, and (3) new mutants will your neighbor’s lab contain? ( Here’s the full challenge ) 
 4. Analytics 
  With programs like  Google Analytics  and  Mixpanel , you have lots of data at your fingertips already. But do you know what to do with it? 
 Sure, you know your total visitors and you’re seen the colored map of visitor locations, but do you know whether people are more likely to buy from an  Android running Chrome or an iPhone running Safari ? 
 The real power of analytics comes in segmenting visitors (by platform, country, source, demographics, etc) and discovering the outliers.  Some of these insights will result in major conversion rate boosts when applied to everyone while some will trigger boosts through advanced personalization.

 Challenge Project: Track Phone Conversions 
 You’re not just a normal ecommerce company that can use Google Analytics’  default conversion tracking . Instead, you’re a local pest control chain, and most of your customers convert over the phone. 
 How will you track conversions from your advertisements online through to your conversion on the phone? 
 You’ll need a call tracking service (my favorite’s  CallRail ). Most of those services make it easy to record phone calls as conversions in Google. 
 But what if you want to record your  real  conversions - when customers actually pay? That’s a little more difficult, but still possible: You’ll need to write a custom script that exports from CallRail’s API and imports through Google Analytics’ API based on user cookies. 
 5. Database Querying / SQL 
  GUIs like Google Analytics and KISSmetrics make it easy to do basic analysis, but sometimes you need to really get into the weeds and study your user behavior. 
 If you ran Facebook, for instance, you’d want to know how often users edited their profile, how many new pictures they updated, and how much time they spent browsing the newsfeed. That information wouldn’t be in Google Analytics, but it’s probably tracked in a database somewhere. 
 Using SQL to query that database will give you powerful information to move the dial.  Perhaps newsfeed reading time is directly correlated to recency of content. 
 You’ll only uncover these insights if you know how to query raw databases with SQL. 
 Resources for Learning: 
 
 W3Schools SQL Training  (my favorite) 
 Udemy’s SQL for Marketers 
 Learn SQL the Hard Way 
 
 Challenge Project: 
 Using the  sample databases provided by W3Schools , find the top three employees based on revenue generated. 
 To do this, you’ll need to join a few of the tables provided to determine the value per order and from there the revenue per employee. 
 You could solve this quickly by simply exporting data to Excel, but force yourself to do it through one SQL query.  SQL can handle much larger data sets than Excel, so you may as well practice using SQL from the start. 
 Hint: Most questions you encounter can be answered  here  or with a quick Google search. 
 6. A/B Testing 
  We’ve all seen the  power of a/b testing , but how many people really understand how it works? 
 Beyond creating a one-off button experiment in Optimizely, a good marketer should create a series of experiments designed to increase conversions and contribute to a better understanding of the target customer.  Over time, only about  1 ⁄ 3  of all a/b tests run will likely contribute to an increased conversion rate - the other  2 ⁄ 3  should contribute to a better understanding of your customer. 
 Like most “magical” things, a/b testing isn’t really that complicated once you understand it.  You simply need a document recording all previous tests (hypotheses, results, and screenshots of variations), a document recording all planned experiments, and a testing platform like  Optimizely  or  Visual Web Optimizer . 
 Resources for Learning: 
 
 Unbounce’s Ultimate Guide to A/B Testing 
 VWO’s many case studies 
 Avinash Kaushik’s Primer on Experimentation and Testing 
 
 Challenge Project: Create Your Own Testing Plan 
 Whether for your company or just for your own personal website, create a testing plan.  Looking at  case studies  for ideas, create a list of all the tests you’d like to run and prioritize by potential impact.  Then, as you test, carefully document the results of each experiment (and make sure you achieve  statistical significance ). 
 After running a few of these tests, review what you’ve learned about your target audience. 
 7. Web Scraping 
  More information becomes available online every second, but much is relatively inaccessible.  Imagine the  potential leads you could find  and the  optimization gems you could uncover  if only you could scrape the internet! 
 Happily, you can scrape the web, and you don’t even need to learn programming! 
 With tools like Import.io, you can visually identify the information you want to harvest, and the scraper tool will find and aggregate similar data.  If you’re working in a primarily sales-focused company, this is an invaluable tool.  If your company is B2C, you can still use web scraping for everything from finding potential partners to analyzing your own blog. 
 Web scraping is one of those relatively simple skills that will put you light years ahead of the competition. 
 Resources for Learning: 
 
 Web Scraping for Sales and Growth Hackers  (my favorite) 
 The Content Marketer’s Guide To Data Scraping 
 Guide To Grow Your Blog 10x 
 
 Challenge Project: Find 10 Potential Blog Partners From GrowthHackers.com 
 You run growth at a b2b startup that sells tools for marketers. You know partnerships with bloggers can help drive acquisition, but how do you find the best partners? 
 Using web scraping, pull all the post, user, vote, and comment data from  GrowthHackers.com .  Then, analyze the data to find the most popular blogs that could be potential partners.  If you’re looking for individual influencers, you could do the same thing, but just analyze the users instead of the blogs. 
 For bonus points, you can feed all the URLs you scrape through  SharedCount  to get the social sharing stats also. 
 Your results will probably look something  like this . 
 Most industries have their own niche forums and websites, and you can leverage scraping to uncover the influencers in your market. 
 Start Now 
 The vast majority of people reading this post will  do nothing . They’ll nod wisely, perhaps share the link on Twitter to impress their friends, and continue to the next post in their feed reader. 
 A few people will try to  do everything .  Eagerly jumping in head first, they’ll try to master all these technical skills simultaneously, but within a day or two they’ll give up - overwhelmed by the sheer volume of work they’ve heaped upon themselves. 
 An even smaller group will pick  one skill to start learning today .  Following the principle of serial excellence, they’ll focus on that one goal until they finish, then move on to the next. 
 Reading articles about growth is a good first step, but the real rewards come when you start taking action.

   The Importance of Lead Generation Many businesses are struggling right now—especially when it comes to growth. Let’s talk about the importance of lead generation and it’s impact on business growth. The Importance of Lead Generation in Sales Sure, many of the business struggles as of late are due to the poor economy. But many businesses are having a “lead generation” problem. Salespeople are running out of gas because they believe they’ve hit the limit of people and companies to sell their products or services to. In reality, these salespeople are likely: Looking in the wrong places for new business Don’t have a process for  qualifying/ dis-qualifying leads Don’t have  buyer personas  mapped out properly There is a common misconception that sales is just cold calling as many people or businesses as possible until you get a bite. The truth is, finding the  right  target–or buyer persona–is just as important to sales as actually selling to them. The process of finding this new business is called lead generation. Generating New Sales Leads One of the biggest keys to a successful business is the generation of  new sales leads. A lead is a person or company that has shown some interest in the services or products that your company provides. It can also be a company or person who fits a target group for what you are providing. Without leads, a sales team cannot be successful. Therefore, generating good leads is just as important as refining your pitch or closing well. Generating the Right Leads Now you might be asking, “How do I generate the right leads?” Years ago, leads were developed by meeting people,  cold calling , and purchasing lists. And as any seasoned salesperson knows, pure cold calling has its flaws. Sure, you can generate leads through cold calling and  networking , but this process is very time intensive. And it shouldn’t be the only lead generation source. Thanks to advances in technology, we now have many lead generation options. In the last 10-15 years advances in technology have made it extremely easy to target and acquire ideal leads. How? Social media and search engines have greatly simplified the process of generating leads. It literally takes a matter of seconds to find a multitude of companies and people who fit the criteria for a potential sale. It may take some extra research to find your new lead’s contact information, and then some more time to contact them, but it will still be a thousand times faster than cold calling. It’s now possible to generate an extremely high volume of leads in a short period of time. The more leads you get, the more pitches your sales team is ultimately going to close. For many companies, it will make sense to dedicate full time employees exclusively to working on lead generation. Inbound marketing experts over at  Hubspot  have developed a treasure trove of resources on  lead generation . Take a look and see if you don’t find some of them useful! Once you’ve started collecting some really high quality leads, you might want to learn more about  running an effective prospect meeting  or  overcoming objections . And of course, let’s not forget the power of LinkedIn! Want to grab a tried-and-true process to help you generate sales leads using LinkedIn?  Click here  or on the image below to get started.

Marketer’s will need to develop strategies for long-term nurturing through various tactics, including phone conversations, direct mail or email marketing. Evaluating past strategies is very important, or knowing your frail focuses could prompt an alternate point of view. Know the best strategies to augment, the right investments to make and what the future holds. They don’t naturally fall through be that as it may, it’s up to your business group to guarantee business leads make it all the way down! A strong B2B sales funnel can continually produce customers while keeping the best loaded with valuable new business leads. Correct utilization of social media could be a great edge in promoting a brand of products and services which leads to a successful business campaign.

There are various other players who are small and they are constantly fighting for their consumer base. Invent strategies to bring a smile on your customers face. That is the strategy which will last in the long run. Leave A Comment  Cancel reply Comment

 Market Research 
 
 Definition:   The process of gathering, analyzing and interpreting information about a market, about a product or service to be offered for sale in that market, and about the past, present and potential customers for the product or service; research into the characteristics, spending habits, location and needs of your business's target market, the industry as a whole, and the particular competitors you face  
 
 
 
 
 Accurate and thorough information is the foundation of all
successful business ventures because it provides a wealth of
information about prospective and existing customers, the
competition, and the industry in general. It allows business owners
to determine the feasibility of a business before committing
substantial resources to the venture. Market research provides relevant data to help solve marketing
challenges that a business will most likely face--an integral part
of the business planning process. In fact, strategies such as
market segmentation (identifying specific groups within a market)
and product differentiation (creating an identity for a product or
service that separates it from those of the competitors) are
impossible to develop without market research. Market research involves two types of data: Primary information.  This is research you compile
yourself or hire someone to gather for you. Secondary information.  This type of research is already
compiled and organized for you. Examples of secondary information
include reports and studies by government agencies, trade
associations or other businesses within your industry. Most of the
research you gather will most likely be secondary. When conducting primary research, you can gather two basic types
of information: exploratory or specific. Exploratory research is
open-ended, helps you define a specific problem, and usually
involves detailed, unstructured interviews in which lengthy answers
are solicited from a small group of respondents. Specific research,
on the other hand, is precise in scope and is used to solve a
problem that exploratory research has identified. Interviews are
structured and formal in approach. Of the two, specific research is
the more expensive. When conducting primary research using your own resources, first
decide how you'll question your targeted group: by direct mail,
telephone, or personal interviews. If you choose a direct-mail questionnaire, the following
guidelines will increase your response rate: Questions that are short and to the point A questionnaire that is addressed to specific individuals and
is of interest to the respondent A questionnaire of no more than two pages A professionally-prepared cover letter that adequately explains
why you're doing this questionnaire A postage-paid, self-addressed envelope to return the
questionnaire in. Postage-paid envelopes are available from the
post office An incentive, such as ""10 percent off your next purchase,"" to
complete the questionnaire Even following these guidelines, mail response is typically low.
A return rate of 3 percent is typical; 5 percent is considered very
good. Phone surveys are generally the most cost-effective. Here are
some telephone survey guidelines: Have a script and memorize it--don't read it. Confirm the name of the respondent at the beginning of the
conversation. Avoid pauses because respondent interest can quickly drop. Ask if a follow-up call is possible in case you require
additional information. In addition to being cost-effective, speed is another advantage
of telephone interviews. A rate of five or six interviews per hour
is typical, but experienced interviewers may be able to conduct
more. Phone interviews also can cover a wide geographic range
relatively inexpensively. Phone costs can be reduced by taking
advantage of less expensive rates during certain hours. One of the most effective forms of marketing research is the
personal interview. They can be either of these types: A group survey.  Used mostly by big
business, group interviews or focus groups are useful brainstorming
tools for getting information on product ideas, buying preferences,
and purchasing decisions among certain populations. The in-depth interview.  These one-on-one
interviews are either focused or nondirective. Focused interviews
are based on questions selected ahead of time, while nondirective
interviews encourage respondents to address certain topics with
minimal questioning. Secondary research uses outside information assembled by
government agencies, industry and trade associations, labor unions,
media sources, chambers of commerce, and so on. It's usually
published in pamphlets, newsletters, trade publications, magazines,
and newspapers. Secondary sources include the following: Public sources.  These are usually free, often offer a
lot of good information, and include government departments,
business departments of public libraries, and so on. Commercial sources.  These are valuable, but usually
involve cost factors such as subscription and association fees.
Commercial sources include research and trade associations, such as
Dun & Bradstreet and Robert Morris & Associates, banks and
other financial institutions, and publicly traded
corporations. Educational institutions.  These are frequently
overlooked as valuable information sources even though more
research is conducted in colleges, universities, and technical
institutes than virtually any sector of the business
community. Public Information
Sources 
Government statistics are among the most plentiful and wide-ranging
public sources. Helpful government publications include the
following. The State and Metropolitan Area Data Book  provides a wide
variety of statistical information on states and metropolitan areas
in the United States. Published by the U.S. Census Bureau, it's
available online for $31 through the  U.S. Government Printing
Office  and at larger libraries. The Statistical Abstract of the United States  provides
tables and graphs of statistics on the social, political and
economic conditions in the United States. Published by the Census
Bureau, it's available online for $48 through the  U.S. Government Printing
Office  and at larger libraries. U.S. Industry and Trade Outlook  presents recent financial
performances of U.S. manufacturers and identifies emerging trends.
Published by the Commerce Department in cooperation with
McGraw-Hill, it's available online for $76 through the  U.S. Government Printing
Office  and at larger libraries. The U.S. government online bookstore  at the  U.S. Government Printing
Office  has an abundance wealth of publications on topics
ranging from agriculture, aviation, and electronics, to insurance,
telecommunications, forest management, and workers'
compensation. The  U.S.
Census Bureau website  also contains valuable information
relevant to marketing. The Bureau's business publications cover
many topics and trades--such as sales volume at furniture stores
and payrolls for toy wholesalers--and are useful for small
businesses as well as large corporations in retail, wholesale
trade, and service industries. Also available are census maps,
reports on company statistics regarding different ethnic groups,
and reports on county business patterns. One of the most important information resources you'll find is
the  SBA .
The SBA was created by Congress in 1953 to help American
entrepreneurs start, run, and grow successful small enterprises.
Today there are SBA offices in every state, the District of
Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Guam. Among the
services offered by the SBA are financial assistance, counseling
services through  Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs) , management
assistance through programs like  SCORE , and low-cost publications. The
counselors at SCORE can provide you with free consultation on what
type of research you need to gather and where you can obtain that
information. They may also be able to suggest other means of
gathering the information from primary sources. SBDCs generally
have extensive business libraries with lots of secondary sources
for you to review. One of the best public sources is  the business section of
your public, or local college or university, library . The
services provided vary from library to library but usually include
a wide range of government publications with market statistics, a
large collection of directories with information on domestic and
foreign businesses, and a wide selection of magazines, newspapers
and newsletters. Almost every county government publishes population density and
distribution figures in accessible census tracts. These show the
number of people living in specific areas, such as precincts, water
districts or even ten-block neighborhoods. Some counties publish
reports that show the population ten years ago, five years ago, and
currently, thus indicating population trends. Other public information resources include local chambers of
commerce and their business development departments, which
encourage new businesses to locate in their communities. They will
supply you (usually for free) information on population trends,
community income characteristics, payrolls, industrial development
and so on. Don't overlook your bank as a resource. Bankers have a wealth of
information at their fingertips and are eager to help their small
business customers get ahead. All you have to do is ask. Commercial Information
Sources 
Among the best commercial sources of information are research and
trade associations. Information gathered by trade associations is
usually limited to that particular industry and available only to
association members, who have typically paid a membership fee.
However, the research gathered by the larger associations is
usually thorough, accurate, and worth the cost of membership. Two
excellent resources to help you locate a trade association that
reports on the business you are researching include the
 Encyclopedia of Associations  (Gale Research), and the
 Encyclopedia of Business Information Sources  (Gale
Group). Local newspapers, journals, magazines, and radio and TV stations
are some of the most useful commercial information outlets. Not
only do they maintain demographic profiles of their audiences
(their income, age, gender, amount of disposable income, and types
of products and services purchased, what they read, and so on), but
many also have information about economic trends in their local
areas that could be significant to your business. Contact the sales
departments of these businesses and ask them to send you their
media kit, since you're working on a marketing plan for a new
product and need information about advertising rates and audience
demographics. Not only will you learn more about your prospective
customers, you'll also learn more about possible advertising
outlets for your product or service. Dun & Bradstreet is another commercial source of market
research that offers an abundance of information for making
marketing decisions. It operates the world's largest business
database and tracks more than 62 million companies around the
world, including 11 million in the United States. For more
information, visit the  Dun & Bradstreet Small Business Solutions
website . Finally, there are educational institutions that conduct
research in various ways, ranging from faculty-based projects often
published under professors' bylines, to student projects, theses,
and assignments. You may be able to enlist the aid of students
involved in business classes, especially if they're enrolled in an
entrepreneurship program. This can be an excellent way of
generating research at little or no cost, by engaging students who
welcome the professional experience either as interns or for
special credit. Contact the university administration and marketing
or management studies departments for further information.

KANBAN AND AGILE,https://leankit.com/learn/kanban/kanban-agile/,"Kanban and Agile | LeanKit  End Google Tag Manager   Google Tag Manager  LeanKit Product Overview Platform Integrations Demo Solutions Engineering Manufacturing IT Operations Project Management Pricing Customers Case Studies Reviews Learn Blog Sign Up Free Login Kanban and Agile Kanban is a set of tools you can use to become more agile…to get better at doing agile, scrum, or whatever methodology you choose. Teams practicing Agile, whether they are highly experienced or just starting out, can use Kanban software development to identify and make improvements to their existing processes. For teams just getting started with Agile, Kanban can make it much easier to achieve their goals of achieving a more Agile process flow. Even for experienced Agile teams, using Kanban can lead to new insights and opportunities for improvement. Kanban, at its core, is very simple. Visualize your work Limit your work in process Thanks to Jim Benson and Tonianne DeMaria Barry, authors of  Personal Kanban . Kanban teams use Kanban Boards and Kanban Cards to represent the work and workflow. This can be a physical whiteboard with sticky notes, or a virtual one, using  Kanban Software . After visualizing the work, you will be able to watch how it moves across the board. Kanban teams call this observing the flow of work. When there are bottlenecks in the process, or blocking issues that prevent work from being completed, you start to see it play out on the board. 
                  Stop Starting and Start Finishing!
                 The primary mechanism in Kanban software development for improving the flow of work is the Work-in-Process Limit. You basically set a policy for the team, saying that we’ll limit how much work is started, but not finished, at any one time. When the board starts to fill up with too much unfinished work, team members re-direct their attention and collaborate to help get some of the work finally finished, before starting any more new work. 
                  How does this fit in with my Agile processes?
                 Agile, Scrum and Kanban methods for project management focus on iterative delivery. Teams work in two-to-four-week “sprints” to deliver a small batch of User Stories (each a small part of the desired end product). Teams then get that one small batch of stories completely finished by the end of the sprint. When one sprint comes to an end, you demonstrate the new features to the customer and then plan the work for the next sprint. On a Kanban board, you visualize the flow of work. You can visualize how the work is flowing during the sprint through the very fast iterations of design, develop, and test that happen within each sprint. Or, you can let the flow of work be governed by the kanban board and replace the sprint container with a regular deployment cadence instead. It’s a minor difference on the surface, but it can have a major impact. With the sprint approach, you spend time at the beginning of every sprint trying to estimate and plan a batch of work for the entire sprint. Then you work on it and push hard to have the entire batch completed, tested and deployed by the end of the sprint. When you’re focusing on flow and using Kanban, you could still deploy completed code every two weeks. But instead of going through the whole cycle of planning, estimating and moving a batch of work through to completion, you can move work through the system without batching two weeks of work at a time. Planning and estimating, designing, building and testing can happen for each individual item as it reaches the top of the priority list in the backlog. When there’s capacity on the Kanban board for more work (WIP limits are being honored, and people are available to do more work), they pull the next item to work on. When the two-week cadence comes around, you simply deliver whatever is ready to deliver. This encourages members of the team to take each item all the way through to completion individually, instead of focusing on having a two-week batch of work completed at one time. You ensure that each item is Done. With a capital D. “Done-Done”, some people call it. And you get it to “Done-Done” before pulling the next item available for you to work on. The Agile practice of iterative delivery is a huge improvement over old waterfall or stage-gate project management methods. Focusing on Agile process flow using Kanban can sometimes be even more efficient, resulting in shorter lead times and higher productivity. It can lessen the feeling of always “starting and stopping” without abandoning the value of having a regular cadence to work toward. Does this mean that you’d be abandoning Scrum for Kanban, or abandoning Agile for Kanban? Heck no. Agile and Scrum are both about much more than the sprint. Besides, if you throw out the existing process, be it Scrum, waterfall, or anything else, you’ve got no starting point for your Kanban system. Kanban itself is a process improvement approach, not a process of its own. It’s something you apply to an existing process, like Scrum, or whatever your current process happens to be 
                  Kanban vs. Agile: Is Kanban Agile, then?
                 Eh, not really. When considering Agile vs. Kanban, there are fundamental differences between the two. The ideas behind Kanban come from the world of Lean Manufacturing as a way of doing something called “Just-in-Time” production. It was developed by Toyota (Kanban is Japanese for “Visual Card”) in the 1950s. Further development of the ideas for using Kanban for knowledge work (like software development) was done by David Anderson, Jim Benson, Corey Ladas, Alan Shalloway, Karl Scotland, Alison Vale, David Joyce, and a sizeable community of people interested in applying principles from the world of Lean to software development, DevOps, and other kinds of Knowledge work, beginning around 2007. While Agile is still growing and adapting, most of the ideas we associate with Agile had begun to solidify long before Kanban came around. So, including Kanban as part of Agile muddies the waters a bit. Agile process flow was developed primarily by software developers to define better ways of developing and delivering software. See the  Agile Manifesto . Kanban and the Lean principle of Flow aren’t specific to how we develop software. The flow system works very well for that, but it turns out it also works well in places where Agile’s iterative delivery model has struggled. IT Operations for example, or software teams focused on churning out small bug fixes and enhancements to existing production systems, is a great place where the flow principle produces a ton of value. For some environments, it just isn’t practical to batch up work in two week chunks. The need, for some teams, to respond in real time to a constant stream of incoming requests, makes selecting a batch of them to work on only every two weeks pretty impractical. For that matter, the principles of Kanban software development can work equally well for just about any kind of work: Creating marketing campaigns Event planning Contract negotiation Legal project management Inventory management ….and many more. Since Kanban doesn’t start by assuming anything about your process or what you’re doing, it can be applied to anything that has a process. It can be as simple a process as ‘To-Do, Doing, Done,’ or something far more complex. What kind of work couldn’t benefit from better visibility? What kind of work couldn’t benefit from focusing on getting more work finished instead of starting more new work, whenever you get the chance? So, without abandoning any of the good stuff in Agile, Scrum, Extreme Programming…and without abandoning any of the good stuff about your current process that is already working well for you, you can apply Kanban to it to get better visibility, and apply kanban tools to help you improve the flow of work. Learn how you can use  Kanban to streamline the software development process  today.

Product Development: Turning Months Into Weeks,http://www.mindtheproduct.com/2017/07/product-development-turning-months-weeks/,"Product Development: Turning Months Into Weeks

BY JAMES DOYLE ON JULY 11, 2017

How quickly your definition of “ambitious” can change. Five years ago getting a dog, starting a web company, working on huge projects here at Invoke all would have seemed hugely ambitious to me, but I’ve done them all.

Building an effective real-time chat that syncs perfectly between consumers and supports e-commerce would have been ambitious five years ago. But we’ve just pulled it off in under a month.

We’ve built a consumer-to-consumer (C2C) platform that, through chat, enables users to discuss their purchase, make offers, and determine shipping methods. They can accept the terms, and even generate an invoice. They can conduct business with each other without ever leaving the chat. In the past, building a chat like this would be an incredibly ambitious endeavour. But, thanks to newly available technologies, it was easy for us too.

Simpler, Faster, Better

In the past, you would have needed to invest in some serious servers and work some sort of event-polling magic if you wanted your chat to have a chance of feeling nice and snappy. Now, we live in the good times. There are options like websockets and webRTC to choose from, but we opted for a service we’ve used on other projects: Google Firebase.

Firebase is a service for creating and syncing a real-time database across clients. One user makes a change and everyone else sees it. For our app, a user can immediately see when another user has added a message. All our data is organized in a relatively flat structure—purposefully duplicating the data we think we’ll need to make for simpler data queries. Simpler means faster, and faster means a better user experience.

But what really sells it for us is just how easy it is to get started. The fantastic features and vibrant development community surrounding Firebase make getting your product launched that much more efficient – in fact some large companies have also taken note and are using it. If you’ve ever wondered what song was playing and decided to fire up Shazam, you’ve used this tech too.

A World of Integrations

The scale and community investment that comes from a Google service like Firebase means that not only do you benefit from the core features of the service, you can also easily connect and integrate with other tools. This lets us tackle complex problems at lightning speed.

We needed to be able to let users know when they have unread messages. For this, we used the Amazon Elastic Beanstalk service to deploy a Node.js server. And wouldn’t you know it, Node.js has a Firebase adapter. When it is connected to our database, it listens for changes. When it notices a new message, it stamps it with the time and marks it as unread.

Not only did this help us quickly to let users know about unread messages, but the Elastic Beanstalk service also helps us mitigate any problems we might accidentally create at our end. The “eb” command line tool makes updating code a breeze by stamping each update as a release. That way, if someone accidentally pushes buggy code to the live site, we tap a button and things revert back to normal.

This reversion capability reduces our risk and lets us frequently update and refine the products that are being powered by these tools and services. With ongoing user feedback and analytics to base our decisions on, a release isn’t a big deal. We can just do it.

Cut the Costs

New technologies aren’t just making things faster, easier, and less risky, they’re also making them cheaper.

The chat product we built uses Lambda functions from AWS to schedule emails. Lambda lets us create a schedule that emails our users with any unread messages in their conversations. Why does this matter? It’s because this takes advantage of “on-demand computing.” Instead of paying to run a server 24/7/365, we only pay every few hours when our function runs. It’s the sharing economy of computing, and it can drastically reduce the costs required to run a modern service. In a lot of cases, this could be by over 80%.

So what has the development taught us? We’ve seen that technology solutions like Firebase, Elastic Beanstalk, and Lambda are making the development teams building products happier, but the benefits extend across product teams.

When launches happen quicker, strategy and design teams can analyze how users interact with the product that much sooner and make improvements even faster.

It also means that funding and budgets are freed up to let developers test and refine code. Designers can conduct user tests, and strategists can validate product directions and roadmaps.

Above all, it means that it’s now that much easier to determine exactly where our product is, and what new heights we’ll be able to reach next.

It involves consolidation of two businesses with an aim to increase market share, profits and influence in the industry. Mergers and Acquisitions are complex processes which require preparing, analysis and deliberation. There are a lot of parties who might be affected by a merger or an acquisition, like government agencies, workers and managers. Before a deal is finalized all party needs to be taken into consideration, and their concerns should be addressed, so that any possible hurdles can be avoided. © Shutterstock.com | max sattana In this article, we look at 1) an  introduction to M&A , 2)  motives for M&A , 3)  transaction characteristics , and 4)  regulations and other hurdles . INTRODUCTION TO MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS ‘Mergers and Acquisitions’  is a technical term used to define the consolidation of companies. When two companies are combined to form a single unit, it is known as merger, while an acquisition refers to the purchase of company by another one, which means that no new company is formed, but one company has been absorbed into another. Mergers and Acquisitions are important component of strategic management, which comes under corporate finance. The subject deals with buying, selling, dividing and combining various companies. It is a type of restructuring, with the aim to grow rapidly, increase profitability and capture a greater proportion of a market share. Parties in an acquisition: The  Target  Company is the company that is being acquired. The  Acquirer  company is the company that is acquiring the target. Mergers can be divided into three types: Horizontal merger:  It happens when both companies are in the same line of business, which means they are usually competitors. Example: Disney bought LucasFilm. Both companies were involved in production of film, TV shows. Vertical merger:  This happens when two companies are in the same line of production, but stage of production is different. Example: Microsoft bought Nokia to support its software and provide hardware necessary for the smartphone. Conglomerate merger:  This happens when the two companies are in totally different line of business. Example, Berkshire Hathaway acquired Lubrizol. This kind of merger mostly takes place in order to diversify and spread the risks, in case the current business stops yielding adequate profits. Introduction to M&A   The main difference between a merger and an acquisition is that a merger is a form of legal consolidation of two companies, which are formed into a single entity, while an acquisition happens when one company is absorbed by another company, which means that the company that is purchasing the other company continues to exist. In the recent years, the distinction between the two has become more and more blurred, as companies have started doing joint ventures. Sometimes acquirer wants to keep the name of the acquired company, as it has goodwill value attached to it. Mergers and acquisitions are complex area of a  company long-term strategy . The process takes a long time, at times, even years. It involves number of parties and stakeholders: The two companies which are being merged or coordinating to venture are the main stakeholders, since any changes in the structure of the company is likely impact both companies. Employees will also be affected, since they are an integral part of the companies. At times, during a merger or acquisition employees have to be laid off. The government agencies play a decisive role in any merger or acquisition, as they want to make sure that the M&A does not create a monopoly or impinge on the rights of general public. Any merger of acquisition must not be a hurdle to competitive environment in the industry. Pressure Groups would be interested in the impact the merger or acquisition would have on the environment, worker welfare, consumer welfare and overall social impact the collusion. Some companies manufacture product/services that are controversial, hence detested by some people. Firms must find a way to deal with possible hostility from these people. Competitors would be interested in a possible merger or acquisition between two companies in the industry, since a collusion could threaten to take away their market share as the combined company would be more powerful, financially and strategically. Financial institutions also have a stake in possible merger or acquisition, since the companies involved might have outstanding debt. Alternatively, a company involved in a post-merger or an acquisition might want to borrow more money, so that the financial institutions would have to evaluate the company’s financial standing and ability to repay it later. The Mergers and Acquisitions Process   MOTIVES FOR MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS Synergy From the strategic point of view the main motive behind a merger or acquisition is to improve the company’s performance for its shareholders through  synergy , which is a concept that states that the value and performance of two companies combined will be greater than the sum of the separate individual parts. Two businesses can combine to form one company which can generate more revenues that could be done if they worked independently. This is why potential synergy from merger and acquisition is evaluated before the decision is made. Growth Mergers or acquisitions can exponentially increase the growth of the company, as it has more resources at its disposal. When two companies combine their expertise, assets and market share are also combined, which leads to more opportunity in the market for growth. The market share which was previously shared by two companies will now exclusively belong to one company. The increased market power is likely to generate more opportunities for sales, revenue, and profitability. Acquiring Unique Capabilities Sometimes, mergers and acquisitions take place in order to acquire unique capabilities or resources, which could prove paradigm-shifting for the company. This would include patents and licenses, which the acquiring company will gain access to once the merger is completed. A patent,  license  or certain technology could make a lot difference for the company, which could help it substantially increase sales and profits, since it might create a natural monopoly situation for the new company. When two different companies combine, it could also result in unlocking hidden value, which becomes apparent as resources and experiences combined bring  innovation  and efficiency. Exploiting the Market Market systems in most economies are not perfect, which means there is room for companies to exploit these imperfections to their own advantage. Taking over another company or merger could facilitate a monopoly-like situation, which would give the company an edge over its competitors. Alternately, a merger could be done with a motive to control the  supply of certain raw materials  which will give the company an undue advantage over other companies. As an Answer to Government Policies Mergers and acquisitions also take place in order to cope with adverse government policies, which may require a certain size of a firm to exist. Some governments offer tax breaks and other incentives to large corporations, which encourage mergers as more profit can be made as tax liability is lower. In order to deal with government pressure to survival within an industry, companies mergers and acquisitions have greater leverage to influence government policies. Transfer of Technology Another popular reason for mergers and acquisitions is transfer of technology, especially for highly specialized companies with unique technologies. Companies buy other companies in an attempt to acquire a certain technology which is patented or unique. Subsequently, these technologies are used to make better products/services, hence greater market share and profits. To Handle Large Clients Mergers and acquisitions, especially in the service industry, also take place in order to follow big clients. There are a lot of examples of such M&A activity happening for law firms, since sometimes the clients are so big, it forces firms to merge in order to serve them better. The merged firms have more resources and expertise to handle powerful clients. It also gives companies a way to bootstrap earning, hence better performance at the stock exchange for listed companies. Diversification Mergers and acquisitions allow companies to diversify into other areas of business, hence it spreads risks and present opportunity for more sales, profits and recognition in the market. For example, if clothing store merges with a textile company, it would help both companies, since they would be able to keep a greater margin of profit.  Diversification  can also take place in a totally different industry altogether. For example, if a restaurant chain store acquires a clothing store, it would have reduced its risks, since even if people stop eating out, hypothetically speaking, they could still make money from the clothing store, and other way. Personal Incentives In some rare cases, a merger or an acquisition is initialised due to managers personal incentives in form of higher salary, benefits etc., and has nothing to do with strategic planning. TRANSACTION CHARACTERISTICS There are several methods of payment for an M&A activity described below. Stock Purchase:  This transaction requires acquirer to provide cash, stock, or combination of cash and stock in exchange for the shares of the company being acquired. This requires shareholders’ approval, since shares can’t be bought without their consent. Any gain made by the shareholders on their capital is taxed by the government. Asset Purchase:  This requires acquirer to buy all the target firm’s assets. The payment in made directly to the firm. This kind of transaction may not require shareholders’ approval/permission. Acquirer, in most cases, won’t assume the responsibility for firm’s liabilities, which would mean that the firm being acquired would have to settle the debt on its own. Cash Offering:  This kind of transaction simply requires payment in cash. Security Offering:  In this case, shareholders are given shares of common stock, preferred stock, or in some cases debt of the acquirer. The exchange ratio is calculated bases on number of securities in exchange for a share of target stock. Factors influencing method of payment There are various factors that need to be considered before method of payment is decided. The risk is usually shared among acquirer and target shareholders in a certain ratio. The ratio is decided based on financial standing of each company. Moreover, signaling by the acquiring firm is also important; they are in a much stronger position to dictate terms.  Balance sheet  and other financial documents are an immense help in ascertaining the capital structure of the acquiring firm, which becomes an important consideration when it comes to method of payment. Another important consideration includes the financial leverage the acquirer enjoys. If the company is highly leveraged, more debt wouldn’t be recommended, and liability if the target company will not be assumed. Attitude of Management From the perspective of the board of directors of the target companies, the merger can be classified into two broad categories: A friendly merger:  This happens when the ‘ board of directors ’ agree, negotiate and finally accept an offer. A hostile merger:  This happens when the ‘board of directors’ attempt to prevent the merger. In case of a hostile takeover, takeover defenses are used, with the intention to either prevent the transaction or increase the bid. Directors may trigger pre-offer mechanism, which makes the target company seem less attractive. This prevents the acquiring firm from making a decent offer. Alternatively, directors may try post-offer mechanism, which include addressing ownership of shares, hence reducing acquirer’s power gained from its ownership. REGULATIONS AND OTHER HURDLES Legal Due Diligence It is an important exercise of an M&A transaction and helps both parties identify any legal risks associated with the merger.  Due diligence  also provides an opportunity to minimize those risks. At the initial stage, all corporate documents are thoroughly reviewed which include Articles of Association. It also covers aspects relating to registrations of company’s employees with the regulatory authorities. The second phase includes reviewing details related to company’s shareholders, financial liabilities, contractual rights and obligations. There are several regulatory considerations when performing M&A. In some cases, there is a need to obtain specific approvals from an M&A transaction from government regulatory bodies, especially when the company is part of core economic activities of the country like banking, insurance, electricity or water supply. Some areas of economy require licenses and NOCs to collude. Additionally, government agencies exist that ensure industries stay competitive. M&A transactions usually present a possibility of collusion between firms, in order to raise price and create a monopoly situation. This situation generated extraordinary profits for the company, but exploits consumers, since they don’t have a choice and end up purchasing the goods at a higher price. Competition commissions exist on order to make sure that markets stay competitive. Some countries have foreign capital investment laws, which prevent foreign companies from investing locally or set a certain investment limit. There are no ways around these hurdles, which means that M&A transaction cannot be executed and finished. As the firm grows in size after M&A transaction, a different set of tax brackets may be applicable. This needs to be takes into considerations since it could adversely impact company’s profits. Such a development will be irksome to shareholders and other stakeholders. Labor Laws Some countries have stringent labor laws, which need to be taken into account before M&A transaction take place. Big firms find themselves in spotlight when it comes to labor laws. The acquirer needs to understand how the labor laws are going to impact the company once the merger is complete. Moreover, the politics of labor unions also needs to be understood and reconciled with. Sometimes, the employees are not happy with the proposed merger, which could threaten to disrupt the operations of the company. It must also be made sure that labor is not exploited under the new administration, which can be done by paying a fair wage, providing safe working condition and health insurance.

What is Growth Hacking and How to Use it for Your Startup,http://FI.co/posts/31391,"With digital media always changing, it's important for startups to constantly keep abreast of the best marketing strategies. And that's why marketing expert and friend of the Founder Institute Shivankit Arora has written this guest post that outlines the basic strategies a startup can employ to increase their internet presence.

Growth hacking has been riding the tide in the startup world for a while. While the phrase has been used by marketers more often than before, most of them still limit the concept to search engine optimization, email automation and social media marketing strategy etc.

However, this is not what defines growth hacking.

Growth Hacking refers to a set of marketing channels that will trigger your business growth in a data driven and cost effective fashion. A successful growth hack comprises the following:

Brainstorming and experimenting with a number of hypotheses to come down to a marketing strategy to take your startup to the next level.

Continuously optimising your efforts, CPAs and and user retention with the discovered hacks.

Now that we understand what growth hacking is all about let’s have a look into the growth hacking funnel or what it is popularly known as “startup marketing funnel”.

Growth Hacking Funnel

The growth hacking funnel for startup marketing comprises of 5 stages based on the AARRR model.

Image Source: Referral Saasquatch

Acquisition: For startup or a small business, this stage is where you gain the necessary awareness among your target audience to see results from your marketing efforts. Activation: Now that your audience knows about your business and the services/products you have to offer, it’s time to convert them into customers. This stage helps you take your audience closer to the ‘customer’ stage. Retention: The market is where you meet your competitors. However, there’s must be something that gives you an edge over others. This is the stage where you tap into your USP to convince your customer to keep using your product or service instead of multiple options available in the market. Referral: It wouldn’t be wrong to say that ‘word of mouth’ marketing is the best form of marketing out there. This is the stage that deals with getting more customers out of your existing set of customers. Revenue: This is the end result achieved after optimised execution of all the above steps. Here you need to understand how your business will maintain a healthy cash flow with rising profit margin.

Now that we have a basic understanding of the startup marketing funnel, let’s dive into some these stages with examples from popular startups.

1. Acquisition: How Airbnb generates the right awareness for their product

The founders of Airbnb, Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia, had just raised some initial funds for their business. However soon they started brainstorming better ways to scale their business rather than the current way of paid acquisition.

They began by narrowing down their market research to one basic question.

What are the digital channels where there target audience searches for something more than just a standard hotel experience?

Craigslist was the answer.

The next thing that Airbnb had under their radar was to get their listings on Craigslist too. This would help them get more traction for their own listings.

The results?

Using this hack, Airbnb managed to pull in thousands of users from Craigslist. Moreover, since their listings were much more comprehensive aided with better descriptions and photographs than Craigslist, the idea led to a viral growth cycle.

2. Activation: How to activate users, the ‘PayPal style’

PayPal grew to 5 million users in summer 2000 from 1 million users in March 2000. This is one of the reasons why it is one of the most growth-oriented startup of the late 1990s.

The first step they took to trigger growth is activate users by paying them to sign up. With every sign up, you were credited $20 (apart from $20 for a referral). Over a period of time as the number of signups boomed exponentially, they reduced the bonus offered, eventually fropping down to nothing.

This way PayPal makes a classic example of activating users by awarding them adaptive incentives. While the company did invest in varied advertising practises, the above method was the best hack to achieve lowest CAC.

3. Retention: How Groove pulled down their churn rate by 71%

One of the major obstacles every SaaS company faces is high churn rates. Churn rate is nothing but the percentage of people exiting out of your subscription based business.

Groove was one of them. Groove is an easy to use help desk software for businesses coming at $15 per user.

Although the company had a healthy flow of new users, Groove’s 4.5% churn rate was gradually turning the business model on an unsustainable path.

So the folks at Groove analyzed users who stayed on-board for more than 30 days and the ones who quit before that. They divided people in the following categories:

AT the end of a lot of brainstorming, Groove made up its mind to send targeted emails to people who spent less time on the platform or/and were likely to opt out after 30 days period.

People who were spending less than 2 minutes on the site in one session were sent this message:

For someone who checked in fewer than 2 times in the first 10 days was sent the following message:

The results?

This conversion optimization strategy, helped Groove reduce their churn rate by as much as 71%.

Understanding the point where your users struggle while using your product/service and addressing the same could just save the day for you.

4. Referral: Dropbox fueled their growth by tapping into referral marketing

The success mantra for Dropbox to be one of the most popular tech startups is tapping into the power of referral marketing.

With a paid marketing campaign under progress, Dropbox spent $250 per customer for a product that was priced at $99.

Every friend you referred Dropbox to, was in turn credited with 500 MB additional storage. You got to earn up to 16GB of free space using this hack.

Image Source : Referral Candy

The next thing they gave attention to was making sure the referral process was as smooth as possible.

The key takeaway here is that ‘word of mouth’ marketing is a powerful hack to pull in more users/traffic on-board. Incorporating referral signups/purchases in your business model with complementary incentives for customers can trigger growth.

5. Revenue: The growth engine of PicMonkey

PicMonkey is a company in the photo editing space. But their share of growth hack involves building a great product with a freemium model.

While millions of users were joining in, every month they were editing billions of photos using PicMonkey. While they could access basic filters for free, advanced filters and tools were available for a monthly fee of $4.99.

In addition to this, hundreds of thousands of users pay that subscription price.

Image Source: Fortune

The company has been riding the tide of increasing profits ever since, with the exact growth being 40% year over year.

The major takeaway here is that going freemium could be the ultimate growth hack for your business. Offering a part of your service as free is a way of educating them how good your product is and in turn assuring them of the value they’ll get once they purchase the premium product/service.

In a nutshell, growth hacking isn’t just about SEO or social media marketing. It comprises of an optimised mix of digital marketing strategies and tools that can pull in significant traction for your business in a cost-effective way.

        The Trick to Viral Growth

 I recently helped a friend prioritize their measurement framework for a series of growth experiments. Here's a lightly edited version of my advice.   When looking to focus on user growth, it's generally helpful to look at 3 key metrics.      Time to first share   length of sharing period   k factor (how many new users does each user bring in).   The time it takes for a user share for the first time dictates how quickly you start growing. Most explosive growth applications have invite friends features early in the signup/usage flow.   Length of sharing period will tell you how sustained your user growth will be. If you have an actively engaged user who will continue inviting users for a long time, you'll be less reliant on having to goose growth through new user acquisition methods. This number will be directly tied to your engagement metrics.   The K Factor is a simple calculation of how many users each new user brings in over a period of time. If you get this number over 1, you have an application that will continue to grow virally until it runs into saturation.   If you're working on a new project, you'll generally want to analyze these on fairly short timelines (what happens day to day or week to week). You'll also probably focus first on time to first share is because that's the fastest way to get feedback/data on whether your product and acquisition flows work. 
 
 
 
   Usually that's the best place to start; you can move on to longer timeframes and the other two factors after that.

 Recent news coverage
of Hot Bread Kitchen reads as if it were written about two
different organizations. The New York City bakery is widely acclaimed
for its innovative selection of international breads, but it
is simultaneously an award-winning  workforce development  program.
Hot Bread Kitchen is a hybrid organization: Its employees,
mostly low-income immigrant women, bake bread inspired by their
countries of origin, while learning job skills that can lead them to
management positions in the food industry. In this way, Hot Bread
Kitchen combines two traditionally separate models: a social welfare
model that guides its workforce development mission and a
revenue generation model that guides its commercial activities. 
 To outside observers, combining social welfare and revenue
generation models might seem unnatural. But Hot Bread Kitchen’s
founder, Jessamyn Rodriguez, whose professional experience
includes training at Daniel Boulud’s flagship restaurant as well as
a decade working in international development, pursued a vision
for how each would complement the other. The business model
would use product sales to fund its social mission, reducing dependence
on donations, grants, and subsidies, as well as to scale
up the organization. Rather than take a  nonprofit  model and add a
commercial revenue stream—or take a for-profit model and add a
charity or service program—Hot Bread Kitchen’s integrated hybrid
model produces both social value and commercial revenue through
a single, unified strategy. 
 Hot Bread Kitchen exemplifies a larger trend among social innovators
toward creating hybrid organizations that primarily pursue
a social mission but rely significantly on commercial revenue
to sustain operations. Such hybrids have long existed in certain
sectors, such as job training, health care, and microcredit—but in
recent years they have begun to appear in new sectors, including
environmental services, consulting, retail, consumer products, catering,
and information technology. 
 As part of the first large-scale, quantitative research study of
nascent social entrepreneurs, 1  a collaborative team from Harvard
Business School and  Echoing Green , a nonprofit with a 25-year record
of supporting early stage social entrepreneurs, reviewed more
than 3,500 recent Echoing Green Fellowship applications 2  to better
understand hybrid models. Over the last five years, applications
from organizations that combined earned and donated revenue
grew significantly: In 2010 and 2011, almost 50 percent relied on
hybrid models vs. 37 percent in 2006. These entrepreneurs sought
to address social issues in domains as diverse as hunger, health
care, economic development, environment, education, housing,
culture, law, and politics. This recent increase in the number of
hybrids results in part from social entrepreneurs’ willingness to
be less dependent on donations and subsidies, as well as from an
increased interest in creating sustainable financial models in the
wake of the 2007-08 financial crisis. 
 Like hybrid species in nature, hybrid organizational models can
be a fountain of innovation. But they also face distinct challenges
that may prevent them from thriving. When organizations combine
social mission with commercial activities, they create unfamiliar
combinations of activities for which a supportive ecosystem may not
yet exist. Hybrids also must strike a delicate balance between social
and economic objectives, to avoid “mission drift”—in this case, a
focus on profits to the detriment of the social good. 
 This article examines hybrids and the specific challenges they
face in legal recognition, financing, pricing of goods and services,
and creating a balanced organizational culture. We also explore
emerging solutions to these challenges for those seeking to combine
the value-creating potential of for-profits and nonprofits. 
 Integration as the Hybrid Ideal 
 The organization of the commercial and social sectors has long been
governed by an assumption of independence between commercial
revenue and social value creation. For more than a century, activities
necessary to create commercial revenue, it was assumed, could
not substantially affect or improve on social welfare, and vice versa.
Thus most organizations that sought to pursue social value and commercial
revenue simultaneously pursued differentiated strategies. 
 For instance,  corporate philanthropy  programs were viewed as a
nonbusiness activity and were conducted at arm’s length from corporations’
core activities. On the other hand, many nonprofit organizations
attempted to sell products or services, creating revenue
streams to reduce dependence on philanthropic and public funders.
Yet earned income programs, often unrelated to the core activities
of nonprofits, did not always live up to expectations. 3 
 Today it is clear that the independence of social value and commercial
revenue creation is a myth. In reality, the vectors of social
value and commercial revenue creation can reinforce and undermine
each other. The social consequences of the recent financial crisis
demonstrated with great clarity the danger of “negative externalities”—social costs resulting from corporate profit-seeking activities.
But in some cases, “positive externalities” may also exist. It is this
possibility that integrated hybrid models seek to exploit. 
 When we talk to entrepreneurs and students about hybrid organizations,
a common theme that emerges is what we call the “hybrid
ideal.” This hypothetical organization is fully integrated—everything
it does produces both social value and commercial revenue. 4 
This vision has at least two powerful features. In the hybrid ideal,
managers do not face a choice between mission and profit, because
these aims are integrated in the same strategy. More important, the
integration of social and commercial value creation enables a virtuous
cycle of profit and reinvestment in the social mission that builds
large-scale solutions to social problems. 
 Perhaps the most visible example of the pursuit of the hybrid ideal
is microfinance. For many, the revolutionary appeal of the microfinance
movement was that poverty might be alleviated in a way that
does not require continuous subsidies. When carefully managed, an
additional loan can equal both more revenue and more of the desired
social impact. As we have seen in microfinance and other industries
where hybrids have grown, however, the real-world pursuit of the
hybrid ideal is fraught with potential missteps. Recent scandals and
critiques of microfinance institutions have focused on a drift away
from social mission to more typical for-profit priorities—leading
many observers to question whether social problems, such as extreme
poverty, can be solved through strategies that also produce revenue. 
 Despite these obstacles, our research reveals that some hybrids
manage to integrate social and commercial activities sustainably.
Still, even when leaders manage to avoid mission drift, integrated
hybrids can struggle to find a suitable place between the for-profit
and nonprofit sectors, especially in their quest for legal recognition
and access to capital, markets, and labor. We review these challenges
in the four sections below. 
 Challenge #1: Legal Structure 
 Until recently, organizations in most countries had two main legal
structure options, each offering certain benefits. For-profits focus
for the most part on shareholder value maximization and are permitted
to distribute returns to investors. Nonprofits singularly
pursue a charitable purpose, and in return, governments offer substantial
tax benefits. Nonprofits also benefit from social legitimacy
and goodwill that attracts grants, donations, volunteers, pro bono
professionals, and other free or inexpensive resources. 
 In this context, an entrepreneur seeking to create a hybrid organization
faces a difficult and often confusing dilemma. If the organization
becomes a nonprofit, selling products or services, it may have to
pay tax on revenues associated with those activities and it could also
lose its tax-exempt status if the activities are sufficiently disconnected
from its primary charitable purpose. Yet, if the organization becomes
a for-profit, it may be discouraged from pursuing social impact by the
pressures of competitive markets as well as fiduciary responsibilities
that generally prioritize profit maximization over other concerns. In
other words, hybrid entrepreneurs can claim the organizational benefits
of only one of the multiple forms of value they create. 
 Indeed, a hybrid that registers as a nonprofit cannot access equity
capital markets because it cannot legally sell ownership stakes
to investors. But if a hybrid incorporates as a for-profit, it cannot
offer the same tax benefits to donors as registered nonprofits can,
even if these approaches lead to the most effective social solution.
Further complicating the choice is the reality that entrepreneurs
cannot fully anticipate their future resource needs at the time legal
registration choices are made, and thus risk being prematurely
locked in to one sector or the other. 
 One solution adopted by a number of hybrid entrepreneurs is to
exploit the benefits of both legal structures. This typically entails the
creation of two separate legal entities, one a for-profit and the other a
nonprofit. Embrace, an organization attempting to commercialize a
low-cost incubator for premature infants, was originally a nonprofit
 social enterprise . After testing the product in India, the organization
explored various options for financing further growth—but found the
financing alternatives under the 501(c)(3) umbrella to be limited. To
access a wider pool of capital and scale up its operations, Embrace created
a for-profit called Embrace Innovations. The nonprofit owns equity
in the for-profit, a structure that gives the nonprofit power to control
the activities of the joint venture while protecting its social mission. 
 Despite its benefits, this multiple-entity approach also entails
complex design requirements and administrative separation that can
burden management. To create better options for hybrids, several
efforts are under way to establish new types of legal structures. In
the United States, there are three such forms: the L3C (Low-Profit
Limited Liability Company), the Benefit Corporation, and the Flexible
Purpose Corporation. The L3C is a variant of an LLC, designed
primarily to enable companies to access investment from tax-exempt
sources such as private foundations. The Benefit Corporation is a
corporate form passed in seven states and pending in four others
that requires organizations to consider a designated social purpose
and corresponding social impact alongside financial analysis in
making strategic and tactical business decisions. The Flexible Purpose
Corporation, which has passed in California and Washington
(where it is called the Social Purpose Corporation), requires boards
and management to agree on one or more social and environmental
purposes with shareholders, while providing additional protection
against liability for directors and management. 
 Around the world, other hybrid legal structures have emerged. In
the UK, for example, a Community Interest Company (CIC) provides
tax benefits to hybrids that agree to limit their distributions to investors.
A CIC, once given governmental approval, has its assets “frozen”
and designated for general community benefit. Investors can receive
capped dividends on their investment, but the principal is never retrieved.
Yet in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, legal registration
is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of how legal systems affect
the growth and success of hybrids. Areas of corporate law, such as
the tax code, were not built for organizations that pursue social and
financial value. Still, the emergence of new hybrid legal structures will
likely encourage increased hybrid activity. What remains to be seen
is which legal structures will be the best fit for hybrids. 
 Challenge #2: Financing 
 As in the case of legal structures, financing has evolved for for-profits
and nonprofits, but not for hybrids. On the one hand, the for-profit
sector has sophisticated vehicles for financing through equity and
debt. On the other hand, a smaller but similarly specialized infrastructure
of national and community foundations, early stage fellowship
grantors, and venture philanthropists exists to provide funding
to the nonprofit sector. Although these sources of nonprofit capital
are scarce, they have long been the typical source of funding for organizations
pursuing a social mission. 
 The current pathway to funding for hybrids is not so clear. One
approach is to adopt a differentiated funding strategy that accesses
profit-seeking investors for commercial activities and nonprofit fundraising
and public subsidies for social activities. Sanergy Inc., a waste
conversion startup that installs toilets in some of the poorest slums in
the world, leverages such an approach. During 2011, Sanergy’s leaders
created two organizations: a nonprofit and a for-profit, each of which
is uniquely dependent on the other for its sustained existence. Under
this hybrid structure, the for-profit develops and scales up capitalintensive
sanitation technology and infrastructure, and the nonprofit
supports sanitation infrastructure and services within low-income
communities. Reflecting on this funding approach, David Auerbach,
Sanergy’s co-founder, said: “We’ve found that grant funders are comfortable
with the social mission priorities in the nonprofit, and that
investors like the fact that we cannot fulfill our financial goal without
actually providing hygienic sanitation. Both are inextricably linked.” 
 Instead of relying on a differentiated funding strategy, many hybrid
entrepreneurs focus initially on getting funding from the nonprofit
sector. Apart from traditional nonprofit sources of funding in the form
of grants or donations, program-related investments (PRIs)—which
enable private foundations to allocate investments through equity,
debt, or a mixture of both—have increased access to capital for US hybrids.
We find that many hybrid entrepreneurs have been able to find
supportive capital partners through this type of early stage financing. 
 Meanwhile, some hybrid entrepreneurs have started targeting
more typical for-profit sources of funding. In the case of Frogtek—a
for-profit social venture that develops business tools for microentrepreneurs
in emerging markets—CEO David del Ser decided to incorporate
as a for-profit because he believed startup financing could come
from mainstream venture capital, enabling faster growth. But del Ser
admits that attracting venture capital has been significantly more
challenging than initially envisaged. He attributes the difficulty to
investors’ inability to quantify Frogtek’s risk even though the return
potential is attractive. Still, Frogtek has been successful in engaging
angel investors whose values align with those of the organization. 
 Clearly, traditional early stage equity financing methods used
by the venture capital industry are not suited to social ventures.
Rather, investors who embrace the same dual objectives as hybrid
entrepreneurs are needed. One such group is impact investors who
are comfortable with hybrid models and their blend of social value
creation and commercial revenue. Despite recent estimates that the
global impact investing market will be at least $500 billion within
the next decade, 5  most hybrid entrepreneurs we have encountered
still experience difficulty in raising capital. Solving this challenge
will require changes in the mindsets of investors, who will have to
accept a return that can range from a below market to market rate,
as well as improved capital placement structures. 
 Challenge #3: Customers and Beneficiaries 
 Traditional businesses usually think of their consumers as customers,
whereas traditional nonprofits think of their consumer base as beneficiaries.
Hybrids, however, break this traditional customer-beneficiary
dichotomy by providing products and services that, when consumed,
produce social value. When consumption yields both revenue and social
value, customers and beneficiaries may become indistinguishable.
This kind of integration is powerful, in part because it resolves the
deeply felt tension between mission and growth. When customers
and beneficiaries are the same, focusing on growth doesn’t take away
resources from beneficiaries; rather, growth of sales and fulfillment
of mission are inseparable. It should be no surprise that many of the
fastest growing hybrids have this feature, including microfinance
and other models in the developing world that produce goods and
services for the bottom of the pyramid. 
 Depending on the social issue that they aim to address, however,
hybrid entrepreneurs may not be able to integrate social value
creation with earning commercial revenue in a single transaction.
An obvious challenge to this type of integration is that many beneficiary
groups lack the financial means to pay for the value they
receive from a product or service. Even when products or services
create financial value for beneficiaries, the realization of that value
may be so distant that it is impractical to recapture. For example,
educational programs might increase a child’s future earnings, but
organizations cannot recoup the child’s future wealth. For this and
a myriad of other areas addressed by the social sector, integration
of customers and beneficiaries may never be possible or desirable. 
 Hybrid organizations addressing these types of social problems
typically differentiate between customers and beneficiaries. Mobile
School, a Belgian nonprofit, for example, provides educational materials
to children who live on the streets through a “mobile school,”
basically a box on wheels containing blackboards and educational
board games. Because Mobile School serves poor children, it cannot
sustain its operations through selling materials or equipment to its
beneficiaries. Instead, founder Arnoud Raskin launched a consulting
business, Streetwize, which is incorporated as a social purpose
company in Belgium. Streetwize’s activities, which are separate from
Mobile School, generate revenue to sustain the nonprofit’s operations.
The board members of Mobile School are shareholders of Streetwize. 
 Although they can be effective and sustainable, such differentiated
approaches raise a number of challenges for hybrids that may
need to make trade-offs between serving customers and beneficiaries.
As Raskin puts it, “When we created Streetwize, there was a risk
for Streetwize and Mobile School to grow into two disconnected
organizations. Although they are two separate entities, engaged
in different activities, the challenge is to make sure that they both
remain focused on the mission of Mobile School. I view my role as
making sure that we never compromise on this.” 
 Yet such differentiated approaches are not the only options for
hybrids. Some still have different populations of customers and beneficiaries,
but their social and economic activities are more integrated.
The beneficiaries of Hot Bread Kitchen, for example, produce and
sell a product for customers, while learning job skills. In this case,
social value is intimately related to sales, but is not contained in
the product or service itself. Certain products and services that are
valuable to both customers and beneficiaries create opportunities
for even more integrated models. Indeed, for some hybrids such as
commercial microfinance organizations, the beneficiaries of the service
are the only customers of the organization. This overlap enables
the organization to focus on one set of activities that fulfill its social
and financial objectives. Like all hybrids, however, these organizations
are still subject to the risk of mission drift, as they may give
priority to profit seeking over social mission. This drifting may lead
them to either start charging higher prices or expand their customer
pool by targeting wealthier and more profitable market segments. 
 Challenge #4: Organizational Culture and Talent Development  
 All hybrid organizations face the challenge of remaining focused on
their missions. At early stages, the passion and dedication of the entrepreneur
can organically communicate such commitment within
the organization. But as organizations grow, the influence of entrepreneurs
on new staff becomes less direct and powerful. When direct
influence weakens, culture becomes a critical means by which
beliefs and values are communicated and maintained. Hybrids face
the special challenge of building an organizational culture committed
to both social mission and effective operations. 
 To keep the mission on course while still making enough money to
sustain their operations, the leaders of hybrids must make deliberate
cultural decisions. First, they must identify and communicate organizational
values that strike a healthy balance between commitment
to both social mission and effective operations. Equally important
is the selection, development, and management of employees who
are capable of recognizing and pursuing social and economic value. 
 Because hybrid organizations not widespread, job candidates with
extensive experience or training in hybrid working environments
typically do not exist. The alternative for hybrid entrepreneurs is to
hire either people who have work experience in only one sector—be
it the social or market sector—or a mix of people from both. Hiring
people who all previously worked in the same sector decreases the
likelihood of organizational conflict, but it significantly increases
the risk of mission drift, as employees are likely to slip into the habits
and skills they learned in their previous work. On the other hand,
hiring a differentiated combination of people from disparate sectors
can help the organization better balance its social and economic
objectives but risks conflict between employees. 
 Bolivian microfinance NGO Banco Solidario (BancoSol) was one
of the first to spin off its lending operations into a regulated commercial
organization in 1992, transitioning from a typical nonprofit
organization to a hybrid. As a nonprofit, BancoSol could not keep up
with demand for loans from low-income entrepreneurs. The newly
created hybrid organization would be in a better position to achieve
this mission, as it would be financially self-sustaining. Needing both
social work and banking skills, BancoSol hired a combination of employees
from the social and business sectors and planned to train them
to work together to achieve common goals. According to Francisco
Otero, BancoSol’s first CEO, a balanced organizational culture would
be created by “converting social workers into bankers and bankers
into social workers.” Despite BancoSol’s training efforts, however, the
single-purpose backgrounds of their employees made it hard for them
to adjust to the hybrid model. Those with a social work background
and those with a financial background ended up resenting each other
and fighting constantly, so that the organization could hardly operate. 
 Another Bolivian commercial microfinance organization, Caja de
Ahorro y Prestamo (Los Andes), launched three years after BancoSol.
It learned from BancoSol’s experience and adopted a radically different
hiring and socialization approach. Rather than look for job candidates
with experience in either social welfare work or finance, Los Andes
hired college graduates with essentially no work experience and then
trained them to be microfinance loan officers committed both to the
social mission of the organization and to effective operations. The
idea was that without social-based or profit-based experience, employees
would find it easier to adhere to the hybrid mission. Although
this approach constrained the rate of growth at first, it proved to be
more sustainable. Later, BancoSol changed its hiring and socialization
strategies and adopted an approach closer to Los Andes’. 6 
 Los Andes’ strategy of hiring inexperienced people and socializing
them into a hybrid organization work environment may not always
be ideal for early growth, but many hybrid entrepreneurs we have
studied adopted this approach. For example, Adive, a French nonprofit
that aims to transform the workforce of French corporations
by connecting them with ethnic minority suppliers and entrepreneurs,
has adopted the same strategy. “In the hybrid space, it is often
easier to work with junior people who have no preconceptions as to
what the job entails,” explains co-founder Majid El Jarroudi. “They
can be trained to do the work, while embracing the social mission
and the need to have effective operations.” 
 No matter which hiring approach they choose, hybrids face the
additional challenge of designing compensation systems, tasks, and
governance policies that reinforce an organizational culture committed
to both social mission and effective operations. Los Andes,
for example, developed an incentive system for loan officers that
tied pay to the number and quality of the loans in their portfolios.
The quality criteria used were meant to ensure that the pursuit of
the social mission would remain Los Andes’ priority. 
 The Future of Hybrids 
 In the aftermath of the 2007-08 economic crisis, the global economic
system is still regarded as broken. Calls for reform have
been particularly strong among youth. Vast unemployment, ballooning
debt, and entrenched inequality have left a generation of
young people frustrated with modern capitalism and motivated to
change it. Among the voices for reform, hybrid entrepreneurs are
opening the way for a reformulation of the current economic order,
combining the principles, practices, and logics of modern capitalism
with more inclusive humanitarian ideals. 
 The essence of this movement is a fundamental convergence and
reconfiguration of the social and commercial sectors, from completely
separate fields to a common space. (See “The Hybridization
Movement.”) Hybrid organizations that are currently being
created serve as a testing ground, and we expect that the most successful
models will be replicated (see yellow arrow in the graphic).
Yet hybrid entrepreneurs are not the only actors through which the
hybridization of the economy is happening. Existing for-profit and
nonprofit organizations are also part of this trend. 
 
 
 
   
 
 Using the guideposts of value creation and strategic integration,
one can map the movement of organizations from the commercial
and social sector toward more integrated hybrid forms. Whereas
corporations’ social programs were once primarily philanthropy,
fully differentiated from business core, many are moving toward
the adoption of more integrated social responsibility programs, in
which the creation of economic and social value are coupled (see orange
arrow in the graphic). Similarly, many nonprofit organizations
continue to seek ways to adapt their existing models to generate some
revenue to be less dependent on donors (see blue arrow in the graphic). 
 We expect this hybridization movement to be slow and gradual,
as existing organizations are already embedded in models and stakeholder
networks that constrain major strategic change. For full hybridization
to occur, for-profit and nonprofit organizations and hybrid
entrepreneurs need resources that align with their goal of creating
both social and economic value. Hybrid organizations will require
innovations in legal status, professional training, and capital financing,
so that they do not need to make constant trade-offs between
social and economic goals. At the field level, a critical step will be the
development of measurement and reporting systems that recognize
both social and financial value. The development of this ecosystem
will not be the work of any heroic individual or organization; rather,
it will require the creation of new systems by elected officials, policymakers,
social impact investors, educators, and consumers who lift
up a generation of hybrid organizations and their managers. 
 We are not suggesting that all nonprofits should seek profits. Some
critical solutions to social problems will never be commercially viable,
and it is important that we continue supporting these through grants
and subsidies. Nor do we believe that all corporations are likely to become
fully integrated hybrids. But for many entrepreneurs, integrated
hybrid models offer a promising vehicle for the creation of both social
and economic value. Someday, we may look at the advance of hybrid
organizations as an early step in a broad reformulation of a current
economic order, which for all of its successes has left many disenfranchised.
Hybrid organizations offer a bold, sustainable infusion
of humanitarian principles into modern capitalism. Yet, as with all
sweeping social changes, success will require leadership and persistence.
The promise of hybrids is very real, but much work lies ahead. 
   
 
   
 
 
 Notes 
 
 1  We selected a random sample of more than 3,500, or approximately 40 percent, of 
the total applications received by Echoing Green between 2006 and 2011. We then 
developed a codebook aimed at capturing the demographic profile of the applicants, 
their social enterprise initiative goals, their resource and funding strategies, and 
their approach to measuring future performance. All projects were double-coded by 
two independent experts, who formed a database for our analyses. 
 2  Echoing Green Fellowship applicants self-identify as nascent social entrepreneurs 
using Echoing Green’s broad definition of social entrepreneurs as “visionaries” who 
“develop bold new solutions to society’s toughest problems.” Applicants’ organizations 
tend to be less than two years old. Although we do not claim that Echoing 
Green Fellowship applicants are a representative sample of the broader population 
of social entrepreneurs, they provide a window of unprecedented depth and breadth 
into the field of social entrepreneurship. Also, because Echoing Green’s criteria for 
defining social entrepreneurs are so inclusive, the sample provides a great platform 
for us to look into the rise of hybrids and to examine their characteristics.

 Content Marketing Subscribe Industry insights and news straight to your inbox. “When you combine the Buyer Profile with Buying Insights, you will have clear guidance for the decisions you need to make to win their business.” -  Adele Revella One of the best ways to create content and plan promotional campaigns that truly engage your target audience is by creating a buyer persona. What's a buyer persona, you ask? In a nutshell, a buyer persona is a profile that represents your ideal customer. By creating your own buyer personas, you'll gain the ability to tailor your marketing efforts and connect with your target audience to meet their needs and solve their problems. After all, if you don't know who you're aiming your efforts at, how are you going to sell your products or services? According to a study from Mark W. Schaefer, three to four buyer personas usually account for over  90% of a company’s sales . And in this beginner’s guide, we’re going to show you how to create your own buyer personas to increase your audience, boost brand awareness, and drive more sales. 
Carry out market research When creating a buyer persona, you're essentially creating a personality that embodies a key segment of your audience - and the first step to accomplishing this is to conduct thorough research. To get a gauge on who your customers are, what they want, and what they're looking for you to solve you will need to hold surveys and polls via your social media channels; interview current customers on one-to-one basis, and look at your competitors to see how their customers interact with them online; this will help you gain a better understanding of who you're speaking to on your channels. Personalised campaigns  drive 18 times  more revenue than broadcast emails, so it's important to gain as much information as you can from the word go. Services like  SurveyMonkey  are very useful as they offer suggestions on how to phrase certain questions for your various demographics to ensure that you get the most valuable response to inform your buyer persona campaign. 
 To help you with your efforts, here's a video on creating a user poll on Facebook... 
 
 
 Another effective way to understand your consumers is through social listening. To find out how, read our practical  social listening guide . 
Check your site analytics More data  has been created in the last two years than in the whole previous history of the human race. That’s a lot of data. You can harness this data to strategically focus your marketing efforts and reach out to your customers in a valuable way. Inside your site analytics, you'll be able to see where your site visitors came from, the keywords they used to find you, and how long they stayed on site for once they arrived. This type of data is essential to creating buyer personas as it shows the search terms that led your audience to your site, as well as the devices and platforms they used to get there. This video will help you decide which metrics you need to use to help define your perfect buyer persona. 
 
 
 
Make a buyer persona template Now you've checked your analytics, gathered your data and gained key insights on your customer base; you'll be ready to create a buyer persona template. A buyer persona is a little like a Top Trumps card - only more useful. 
 Here is an overview of what to include in your buyer persona template: Persona name:  It's very important to give your persona a name to bring them to life and humanize your marketing efforts Job title Essential information about their company (size, sector, etc.) Details about their job role Demographics Age Gender Salary or combined household income Location: are they from an urban, suburban or rural region Level of education Family size Goals and challenges Main goal Secondary goal How you help your persona reach these goals Primary challenge Secondary challenge How you can assist in resolving these problems Values and fears Main personal values Common objections during sales process Marketing message Think about how you might describe or communicate your product or services to this particular type of person? Elevator pitch Elaborate on your marketing message and decide on a consistent message based on how you're going to sell yourself to this customer. Here is an example of a basic buyer persona. 
 
 
 
Add extra customer-specific information In addition to the core details on your template, you should add extra snippets of information relating to your particular customer base; not only will this help you target your efforts more specifically, but it will also help to breathe extra life into your personas. Each buyer persona template can be changed slightly to meet your needs, but as a guide, this information will assist you with your efforts. Level of digital competency Personal hobbies Preferred news sources Favourite blogs Most used social media platform Direct quotes from existing customer interviews 
The power of a solid buyer persona More often than not, it's easy to spot a business that understands the value of a solid buyer persona - and knows how to use it to their advantage. JetBlue is a shining example. JetBlue's primary buyer persona is the low budget traveller that seeks a comfortable yet affordable solution to flying. Understanding its audience is young and likes to make the majority of their decisions through social media, JetBlue has crafted its efforts accordingly, picking up plenty of traction on Twitter in particular. In fact, according to a recent report from TalkWalker, JetBlue sees   74.1%  of its overall social media performance from Twitter. 
 By taking on a fun, conversational tone, using slogans like 'Flying like a boss', and focusing on responding to their followers almost instantaneously, the company has earned 477 thousand followers to date, and is following just one account themselves. Even their handle -  @JetBlueCheeps  - appeals to their key buyer persona. As a result of its refined marketing efforts, aided by the company's 'Travel like a boss' campaign, and driven by its attention marketing personas, the company saw a 7.9% increase in profit in 2016 from the previous year. A clear indication of how buyer personas can help a company improve its brand message, appeal to its target audience and reap the rewards of ongoing commercial success. By following the above steps and taking the time to create at least three key buyer personas for your company, you'll be able to create content and launch campaigns that not only sing to your audience but will help you brand grow and evolve with your customers.

Don’t Build a Business Unless You’re Ready to Give Your All,http://FI.co/posts/28951,"Adeo Ressi, the co-founder and CEO of the Founder Institute, is a major proponent of perseverence as an entrepreneurial virtue. Because so many aspiring founders, unfortunately, believe that launching a company is easy and is an effective means to gain money and fame, Adeo, along with those of the rest of us at the Founder Institute, have set out to prove that only the most passionate, dedicated, and resourceful will have what it takes to survive in the startup world.

Adeo recently wrote an article about the topic of commitment in the Forbes article, ""A Business Is Not Worth Building Unless You Are Ready To 'Go All In'"". Below are some of the key points.

I’ve started 9 businesses and have invested all of my time, all of my network, and most of my money into each and every one of them. Most have done well and others have failed, but I wouldn’t advise an entrepreneur trying to build an impactful company to pursue any other strategy.

Here’s why:

1. Building an Impactful Company Requires 100% of Your Time

I am always surprised by how many founders tell me things like “I can’t quit my job to build this business until I get some funding.” This line of thinking of completely backwards, and naive. What investor in their right mind would take the risk of investing in your company if you (the founder) won’t even take on the risk of future earnings to devote your time to it? Realistically, the founders that tell me this are hundreds of steps away from getting investment – but even then, do they really expect talented people to go out on a limb to join their team full-time if they’re not willing to do the same? Unless you have an amazing track record in entrepreneurship, this is non-negotiable.

To be clear, I am not saying that a business can’t begin as a “side-project”. On the contrary, I believe starting a “side-project” before fully committing is the absolute best way to start a company. When it is just a “project” (not a “business”), you aren’t too attached to it, and you can look at things objectively while testing the idea with customers, researching the economics, and getting feedback from experts.

However, once you have put in several months (at least) and have gotten the proper validation, you need to devote 100% of your time to build the business if you want to have any chance of success. Realistically, this means 60+ hours per week for several years.

2. Building an Impactful Company Requires 100% of Your Network

If you are trying to build something of impact, then you need to quickly get comfortable with asking your friends, family, and colleagues for favors. These favors include, but are not limited to, sharing your news, giving you feedback on your product, providing introductions, handing over money (buying your product/ investing in your company), and more.

As awkward as this may seem, there is really no getting around it. As an early-stage entrepreneur you usually have no tangible product to sell, so all you can sell is a vision or idea. This is actually very similar to a politician starting a “movement” – and a “movement” requires an initial audience to get it going.

To force this thinking on early-stage entrepreneurs that are not quite ready to go “all-in”, in the first week of the Founder Institute we mandate that our founders create a mailing list of at least 20 friends, family members, and associates. After sending an initial introductory email where people can silently opt-out, the founders then send this mailing list business updates and requests for feedback on a weekly basis. To push things further, we even require our founders to add people to the list every week, and when they finish our program they have over 125 subscribed contacts that they know personally or met in the program.

Is this overkill? To be honest, when we first implemented this strategy the required subscriber numbers were much lower. However, over time we have moved the requirements higher and higher because it has be so effective. At the end of the day, this simple mailing list has acted as a forcing function that not only gets our founders comfortable with selling to personal acquaintances, but also provides them with a wide net of people from which to get valuable feedback, spread news, and more.

If you are not comfortable asking friends, family and colleagues for favors related to your business, then I suggest you do something similar. Trying to build your company alone is usually a fool’s errand.

3. Building an Impactful Company Might Require All of Your Own Money

It does not always require 100% of your money, like numbers 1 and 2 above… but it might.

This is what startup people call “skin in the game”. Joining, investing in, or partnering with a startup is always a question of risk management, and the most remedial question someone can ask to mitigate risk before working with you is “Are you committed?”.

There is a difference between interest and commitment. When you’re interested in something, you do it only when it’s convenient. When you’re committed to something, you accept no excuses, only results.” – Kenneth H. Blanchard (Author of The One Minute Manager)

Most of the successful entrepreneurs you read about today have invested most of their money into their businesses at the early stage, while also taking either a very low or the legal minimum salary for the first several years. I have done the same with all nine of my businesses.

Obviously not everyone has the luxury to do this, but at the very least, they should expect to front the initial costs of the business (incorporation, legal, basic technology/materials, and the like), while also offering much higher salaries to their first key hires than their own. After all – what signifies more commitment from the founder than cold hard cash?

Okay, so let’s say you have read my three points above but are still wavering and not quite ready to go “all-in” with your time, network, or money. What should you do?

At the very least, I recommend that you take a step back and ask yourself two key questions:

Am I fully committed to this idea?

If you are ready to go all-in but do not believe you have validated your idea, you can usually find the answer by (1) isolating your area of concern, (2) getting feedback on it through a well-constructed “MVP Test” with a few hundred more potential customers, and (3) reviewing the results with someone that successfully built a business targeting the same customer. If you are not sold after that, then it’s time to significantly alter (“pivot”) your idea, or start over altogether. Keep in mind that this is not a bad thing – it is better you learn this sooner rather than later.

Am I ready for the rigors of starting a business?

If you believe you have validated your idea but are still not ready to go all-in, then work backwards and create a plan that will get you to that point. Maybe you have a child on the way, or other family obligations on the horizon? Maybe you need to save up money and start another “side-hustle” in the interim? Or, maybe you need to take time creating relationships that will be crucial for your business to succeed? Whatever the situation, just create an actionable plan to get you there as quickly as possible. I promise you that the longer you wait, the more your chances of getting started and succeeding diminish.

The Core Tenets of Jobs-to-be-Done Theory,https://jobs-to-be-done.com/the-5-tenets-of-jobs-to-be-done-theory-ba58c3a093c1,"The Core Tenets of Jobs-to-be-Done Theory - Jobs-to-be-Done + Outcome-Driven Innovation Sign in Get started History Frameworks Templates Podcasts Case Studies Leadership Fallacies The Core Tenets of Jobs-to-be-Done Theory With decades of scrutiny in both academic and practitioner settings, these core tenets of Jobs Theory have emerged as the building blocks of predictable growth. Tony Ulwick Follow Nov 28, 2017     ·       12    min read Science is about process: observing, making inferences about those observations, and then performing tests to see if the inferences are indeed true. Toward that end, science employs a particular vocabulary for describing how ideas are proposed, tested, and supported or disproven. And that’s where we see the difference between a  hypothesis  and a  theory. In scientific reasoning, a hypothesis is constructed before any applicable research has been done. A theory, on the other hand, is supported by evidence: it’s a set of principles or tenets formed as an attempt to explain things that have already been substantiated by data. The Hypothesis When IBM announced the PCjr in 1983, it was immediately declared a flop in the press — and as it turned out, they were right. As a humbled engineer on the IBM product team, I wondered how they were able to quickly and accurately predict the product would fail. I wondered what metrics they used to judge the value of IBM’s new home computer and how they knew they were the right metrics. Months after contemplating the PCjr debacle, I constructed this hypothesis: It seemed to me that if a product team could know what metrics its customers were going to use to judge its new offering well in advance of product development, it could design the product to address those metrics and predictably deliver a winning solution. Proving this hypothesis raised a number of challenging questions: What metrics should be captured, and from whom? How do we make sure the metrics remain valid/stable throughout a multi-year development cycle? Do we need to prioritize the metrics? Will all customers agree on the priority of the metrics, and if not, how will that be reconciled? Solving these challenges led to the creation of  Outcome-Driven Innovation®  (ODI), a strategy and innovation process that was first used outside of IBM in 1991 to help Cordis Corporation introduce a new line of angioplasty balloons. This led to a dramatic increase in market share (from about 1% to over 20%) and was the first of many successes. In 1999, I introduced ODI to Clayton Christensen (see  here ) as a possible solution to “the innovator’s dilemma”. He went on to popularize the underlying ODI theory in his best seller,  The Innovator’s Solution,  labeling it “jobs-to-be-done theory”.   Since that time, we have independently worked to advance the theory— Clay through the lens of a well-respected Harvard Business School professor, and I through the lens of a practitioner. Jobs-to-be-Done Theory A  theory   is a set of tenets that has been formed as an attempt to explain things that have already been substantiated by data. Jobs-to-be-Done Theory is comprised of a group of principles or tenets that explain how to make marketing more effective and innovation more predictable by focusing on the customer’s job-to-be-done. Christensen and I, based on what we have published, agree on 6 of the 9 tenets (below) that form the foundation for Jobs-to-be-Done Theory. Our opinions differ slightly on tenet 5 as I will explain, and it is unknown to me whether or not Christensen would support tenets 7, 8 and 9, as they have not appeared in his writings. The core principles and tenets behind  Jobs-to-be-Done Theory  detail a sound and proven theory because they are based on evidence, verification, and repeated testing by the Strategyn team over a 26-year period. Using ODI, the theory was applied over 1000 times in applications such as: (i) product, software, service and operational innovation, (ii) product improvement and new product creation, (iii) business-to-business and business-to-consumer applications, and (iv) in over 30 industry verticals. Consequently, when companies apply Jobs Theory to better inform their strategy, marketing, innovation, development and M&A initiatives, they can confidently use these 9  Jobs-to-be-Done Theory tenets  as the building blocks for predictable growth: People buy products and services to get a “job” done. Jobs are functional, with emotional and social components. A Job-to-be-Done is stable over time. A Job-to-be-Done is solution agnostic. Success comes from making the “job”, rather than the product or the customer, the unit of analysis. A deep understanding of the customer’s “job” makes marketing more effective and innovation far more predictable. People want products and services that will help them get a job done better and/or more cheaply People seek out products and services that enable them to get the entire job done on a single platform Innovation becomes predictable when “needs” are defined as the metrics customers use to measure success when getting the job done The implications of each of these tenets on a company’s efforts to create and market breakthrough products and services are far-reaching. Each of these tenets brings new insights into a company’s business practices. (Also see,  What Is Jobs-to-be-Done ). Tenet 1: People buy products and services to get a “job” done People have underlying problems they are trying to resolve. They have goals they are trying to achieve and tasks and activities they are trying to complete. They may be faced with situations they are trying to avoid. In each of these cases, people often turn to products and services to help them get a “job” done. A “job” is not a description of what the customer is doing, the solution they are using, or the steps they are taking to get a job done. Rather, the “job” statement embodies what the customer is ultimately trying to accomplish. The way we (the team at Strategyn and I) put this tenet of the theory into practice is to define the customer and the job as a market: a group of people and the functional job they are trying to get done. For example, parents (a group of people) who are trying to “pass on life lessons to children” (the functional job-to-be-done) constitute a market. Surgeons (a group of people) who are trying to “repair a torn rotator cuff” (the functional job-to-be-done) constitute a market. When a company defines a market in this manner, it clarifies its target customer and the job it is going to help the customer accomplish with a product or service offering it creates. Tenet 2: Jobs are functional with emotional and social components As a customer uses a product to get a functional job done, they often want to feel a certain way and be perceived in a certain light by their peers and/or friends and others. The way they want to feel and be perceived constitutes their emotional and social jobs-to-be-done. For example, when parents are trying to pass on life lessons to children (the functional job-to-be-done), they may also want to feel like they are contributing to the advancement of society and/or want to be perceived as good parents by their peers. These are the emotional and social components they attach to the functional job, respectively. Understanding the emotional and social components of the functional job brings companies rich insights that can lead to the creation of a value proposition that resonates with customers at both a functional and emotional level. The way we put this tenet into practice is to first work with customers to define the market, and then work with them to define the emotional and social jobs associated with the functional job-to-be-done. When conducting qualitative research with a cross-section of job executors, it is common for people to express 20 to 30 emotional and social jobs. The job statements can be captured, quantified and used to inform a variety of marketing and development decisions. Tenet 3: A Job-to-be-Done is stable over time A functional job-to-be-done is often a job that customers have been trying to accomplish for years, decades and in some cases even centuries. Parents, for example, have been trying to pass on life lessons to children since the beginning of humanity. A functional job is stable over time. What changes over time are the products and services that companies offer to help get the job done better. Because the job-to-be-done is stable over time, it is an attractive focal point around which to create customer value. It provides a stable target for market insights, strategy formulation, innovation, R&D and M&A investment, and growth. It also offers insights that can help prevent disruption. In practice, we leverage this tenet by recognizing that a company’s short- and long-term strategy should never change: the strategy should always be to help customers get the entire job done better and more cheaply on a single product platform. This is the long-term strategy that Amazon has pursued since its inception. A stable target and a stable vision bring focus and purpose to an organization. Tenet 4: A Job-to-be-Done is solution agnostic The core functional job is solution agnostic — independent of any solutions or technologies. This tenet is vital to the theory’s claims of success for breakthrough innovation. Innovation isn’t about “a faster horse,” rather it is about getting a job done better. A “horse” is a solution to get a job done. The job (transporting yourself from point A to point B) must be defined independent of the solution (the horse) so altogether new, breakthrough solutions can be conceptualized (e.g., the automobile). Customers don’t know what solutions will get a job done best. So why ask them? Customers couldn’t envision the automobile or the microwave or the smartphone. They are not experts at product definition and design; they are not materials experts and scientists — so asking them what solutions they want is a failed approach to innovation. However, customers do know what job they are trying to get done, independent of the solution they are using or what alternative solutions are possible. Defining the job-to-be-done independent of solutions opens the door to breakthrough thinking. In addition, when a job is defined in this manner, it enables a company to view its competition through a new lens. Instead of competition including only products of a similar nature, competition can (and should) be viewed as any product or home-grown solution that is being, or can be, used to get the job done. Viewing competition through this lens can help a company avoid disruption through technological advancement. Tenet 5: Success comes from making the “job” the unit of analysis Making the job-to-be-done the unit of analysis means it is the job — not the product, the customer, the circumstance, or customer demographics — that is studied, dissected and understood at a granular level of detail. Note:  Christensen’s view on this tenet differs from ours. In addition to saying the “job” is the unit of analysis, Christensen sometimes says the “circumstance” is the unit of analysis — but he defines the circumstance to be inclusive of the functional, emotional and social jobs the customer is trying to get done. When we analyze the job-to-be-done, we begin by creating a job map. A job map is different than a process map or a customer journey map in that it describes, step by step, just what the customer is  trying  to get done (a needs perspective), not what the customer is doing (a solution perspective). To understand the job at a granular level we then define customer “needs” as the metrics customers use to measure success when getting each step in the job done. We call these statements the customer’s desired outcomes. The desired outcome statement, which we created over 25 years ago, is a specially constructed need statement that has a unique set of characteristics: desired outcomes are devoid of solutions, stable over time, measureable, controllable, structured for reliable prioritization in a quantitative customer survey, and  tied to the underlying job the customer is trying to get done  (see  Inventing the Perfect Customer Need Statement  and  Giving Customers a Fair Hearing ). Desired outcome statements describe customer metrics for getting the job done faster, more predictably (without variation) and with high throughput/output. They form the foundation for the Outcome-Driven Innovation process and have many downstream applications. Trained ODI practitioners capture desired outcome statements in qualitative customer interviews and construct them without the customers’ help. With the customer’s desired outcome statements in-hand, companies are able to: (1) identify where and why customers are struggling to get the job done, (2) brainstorm ideas for new offerings, and (3) determine in advance of development which ideas will help customers get the job done best. Tenet 6: A deep understanding of the customer’s job makes marketing more effective and innovation far more predictable In Clayton Christensen’s latest book, Competing Against Luck, he says: “Innovation becomes much more predictable — and far more profitable — when it begins with a deep understanding of the job the customer is trying to get done.” Here’s why: a deep understanding of the customer’s desired outcomes for a given job enables companies to know, often for the first time, all the customers needs. Companies are able to transition from a place where a cross-functional team can’t agree on what a “need” is to a place where they not only agree on what a need is, but they also agree on what all the customer’s needs are (the 100+ desired outcomes tied to the job-to-be-done). This is truly transformational as most companies (and most VoC practitioners) don’t even agree on what a need is ( learn more here ) and end up using customer inputs that derail the innovation process. The fundamentals of marketing and innovation are straight forward: if a team can agree on what a need is, what the customer’s needs are and which are unmet, they are able to (1) better position and sell more of the company’s existing products, (2) improve existing products and services, (3) create new products and services. Jobs-to-be-Done Theory makes this possible. In practice we leverage this tenet by conducting quantitative research that is specifically designed to reveal under- and overserved customer desired outcomes and segments of customers with different unmet outcomes. This unique research, which we have perfected over 2 decades, overcomes the issues associated with traditional market research methods (see  Reinventing Market Research To Put Jobs-to-be-Done Theory Into Practice ). Tenet 7: People want products and services that will help them get a job done better and/or more cheaply We have learned that people aren’t loyal to companies or brands. They are loyal to getting a job done better (faster, more predictably and with higher output/throughput) and/or more cheaply. They replace existing products and services with those that help them achieve these goals. We have learned that some people are willing to pay more to get a job done better, while others are willing to pay less to get a job done worse. Knowing what types of customers exist in your market (and in what proportions) forms the foundation for a new way to think about growth strategy. With a focus on this tenet, we have created the  Jobs-to-be-Done Growth Strategy Matrix  — a powerful framework that helps to explain the dynamics of disruptive innovation and 4 other growth strategies. A webinar detailing this tenet and the matrix can be found here: The Jobs-to-be-Done Growth Strategy Matrix Webinar Tenet 8: People seek out products and services that enable them to get the entire job done on a single platform We have discovered that many products and services available in the market only get part of a job done and that customers are left to cobble together solutions in order to get the entire job done. Customers don’t want to cobble together the solution. They want it presented to them. This finding has important implications. First, your product strategy shouldn’t be ever-changing. In fact it should never change. Your goal should always be to help your customers get their entire job done on a single platform. Nespresso is a great example. The company worked for years with a single strategy in mind: to enable customers get the job of “preparing a hot beverage for consumption” done on a single platform. More importantly, products and services naturally (but slowly) evolve to help customers get the entire job done on a single platform. A company can accelerate this process once it knows what steps comprise the job. In this sense, a Job Map can be used as a blueprint that informs a company what product improvements to make and what M&A and R&D investments to make to create the ultimate solution — years before its competition does. Tenet 9: Innovation becomes predictable when “needs” are defined as the metrics customers use to measure success when getting the job done In order to determine if a new product idea/concept will be able to get a job done better and/or more cheaply, it must be possible to evaluate competing ideas against a stable set of metrics.  The metrics we use to conduct this evaluation are the customer’s desired outcomes. Since the customer’s job-to-be-done is stable over time, the customer’s needs, when defined as desired outcome statements, are also stable over time. (See the Medium article,  Define Customer Needs As Constants ). With a stable set of “needs” in hand, a company is able to: Quantify which needs are underserved and overserved. Discover segments of customers with different unmet needs. Use the metrics as a baseline against which they can test product ideas and concepts  before they are developed . Knowing which product or service concept will get the job done best early in the product planning stages ( prior to development),  is the key to predictable and profitable innovation.

The 7 (Pitching) Habits of Highly Effective Founders,http://500.co/7-pitching-habits-for-founders,"Finding the right investors is like dating — you need to kiss many frogs before you find a prince.

Today, I’m going to share seven ways fundraising founders can kiss fewer frogs and find more princes (subtle hint: Batch 19 applications are now open).

Habit 1 – Pitch to the Right Investors

Not all investors are created equal.

Some investors only invest in seed investments. Some investors only focus on Series A.

Before approaching any investors, do your homework and make sure you go after the right target audience.

You can segment them with these 5 characteristics:

Investment stages (seed, Series A, B, C, etc.) Check size (e.g. $50,000 – $150,000) How many deals has he or she done in past 6 months (you will find out how active this investor is) Industry focus (if any) Geography (most Silicon Valley investors would not invest outside of the Bay Area)

It is certainly quite rare to turn someone who isn’t already engaged in your industry or geography into someone who suddenly cares about what you’ve created.

Habit 2 – Pitch with Purpose

My colleague Andrea Barrica introduced me to this quote by Maya Angelou:

“I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”

What do you want your potential investors walk away with after your pitch?

Keep that in mind and you very likely will change the story you tell and the way you tell it.

Habit 3 – Curate Your Story

It’s harder to tell a short than a long story.

It’s easy to tell your investors everything that’s happened in your life since you were 3, but whittling that down to what they really need to know is much harder — and much more compelling.

Don’t be lazy, or self-indulgent. Put in the extra 20% effort and curate only relevant and story that make you uniquely over qualify for your startup.

Habit 4 – Pitch like a Professional

During your pitch, you need to convey two things: 1) why you are the most qualified person and 2) why investors should give you money now.

Be sure to cover the following if you are ready, but always start with traction & demo if you have it.

Here are 11 things to cover:

Traction, traction, traction Revenue User download User engagement Major signed partnerships Product demo (If you have it. You should have it.) Market size & target market Pain point Product Team (team, investors, advisors) Technology Business model Monetization model Competition Market Trends

Habit 5 – Understand the Big Picture

Most founders I met are in love with their product.

Unfortunately, as an investor, I don’t just want a person who is in love with himself or herself or their product.

I want a founder who truly understands how to create a business. You should be the one who can tell me everything about your competitors, market, legal environment or policy changes.

Habit 6 – 24 Hour Follow Up

After your first call or in person meeting, be sure to follow up within 24 hours and make sure to cover the following in your follow up email:

Thank them!

Your deck

Current traction

Team

Action items

Your ask

Ask for follow up meetings or phone calls

Habit 7 – Show Passion & Honesty

Building a startup is really, really hard work.

As an investor, I want to find someone who won’t back down when things get (even) harder, and is willing to do whatever it takes to make things happen.

A huge part of working hard — and knowing where to work harder — is knowing what isn’t working (yet).

Show your true self, and be honest. It’s ok to say, “I don’t know.” You don’t need to have all the answers, but you do need to have the strength of character and work ethic to figure it out."

 The Behavioural Roadmap for Startups 
 
  Simple Share Buttons Adder (7.6.21) simplesharebuttons.com  Twitter Facebook Linkedin Reddit email This article is written by  Taylor Wescoatt , Expert in Residence at  Seedcamp . Taylor’s background spans 20 years of Product and UX having held key positions at successful startups like Seatwave and CitySearch, and larger brands like eBay and Time Out. This is the second of two articles on Roadmaps for Startups –  the first of which can be read here . 
 The Challenge 
 Now that you’re clear on your  Vision Roadmap , the next step is to figure out what to actually build. A roadmap’s job is to tell you where you’re going, and how to get there. With the Vision Roadmap we have a clearer idea of where we’re going, but that’s too high-level to let us know what to work on tomorrow. 
 Normally roadmaps look something like the below, that is, a bunch of features listed down the left, with delivery timelines Gantt-charted out. These types of Roadmaps say what a company is doing, and what a user is getting, but thats where the problems begin; 
 
 Its out of date as soon as you build it 
 It frustrates Engineering (and others) as too rigid 
 It doesn’t focus on what the Customer wants (which is what matters) 
 
 I believe a roadmap can be built around what the Customer wants and needs. Lets go back to our example of Hogwash which started in the Vision Roadmap piece. One of the initial Propositions we planned to achieve was as follows; 
  “ Hogwash is a convenient way to get the occasional last-minute sparkle on my car” Launch Proposition for the Busy Professional 
 Now our Product Funnel for a typical ecommerce solution (like Hogwash)  might look something like this. These are all key steps we observer on-site, can measure, and reflect our KPIs directly. 
 Unfortunately this misses out on a lot of things that the Customer is going through, many of which you can use. 
 Here’s an example of a full Customer Journey for the same situation. Each step is a “Behaviour” that the customer undertakes in their journey. It starts well before they come to the site, and it ends only after they have demonstrated the behaviour that fulfills the company’s goals. In this case, repeat-purchase. 
 You’ll see that all the key Funnel steps are in there, but there are also steps in there before, after, and between them. The better insight you have into your customer journey, the quicker you can make key decisions like product changes or pivots, and the more advantage you have over your competitors. 
 Have a look at the step between ‘schedule appointment’ and ‘pay’, a place where there’s a particularly steep funnel drop. The step ‘talk to partner’ is just as important, if not moreso, to the Customer, and introduces an additional persona into the equation. Understanding this creates new opportunities in Product. You might address it directly, “Enter your partner’s email here and we’ll send them a summary”, to which you could solicit the partner’s feedback (eg scale of 1-10). Great new data and insight opportunity from simply recognising that this step exists! (Hogwash isn’t real, of course, but the example is real, from another startup) 
 Behaviours are “Actions” performed for “Reasons” with expected “Rewards”. I won’t go deeper on these in this post, but the more clearly you identify and validate these with your customers, the greater opportunity you have to compare, influence, and supplant them with the behaviours you want. The work of  Nir Eyal ,  Nathalie Nahai , and  Dan Ariely  might be really helpful to look at. 
 Now that you’ve got your Customer Behaviours understood, pick the two you want to focus on for the next 90 days. This is your Behavioural Roadmap. Short, sweet, and customer-focused. All those other ideas can be saved for posterity in The Opportunity Cloud, you may get around to them later. Simple, right? I know its not pretty like the ones at the top, but hopefully you’ll find its a lot more relevant. Features don’t drive KPIs, Behaviours do. 
 Now comes the hardest part… coming up with great ideas! There’s no science to creating delight, but make sure you have your best people in the room. By focusing on Behaviours (action + motivation + reward), you have a better chance of coming up with a great idea than if you’re just focusing on features. IDEO’s work in the “ How might we… ” practice is worth looking at. The following three-step process (great article  about Pandora here ) takes you from which Behaviour you want to what Minimum Viable Product tests you want to undertake. 
 
 By focusing in on the entire Customer Journey, and understanding the underlying motivations and rewards for the user, you’ve now developed some serious competitive advantage. Your team is far more empowered to develop great ideas with you, and there is a much stronger sense of purpose and direction to all those late nights you’ll be spending delivering your world-changing idea.

 Startup exits should be positive and planned early.

 If you startup is your dream, why would you want to think about an exit? It’s going to be so successful and so much fun that you don’t need to think about what comes after. Wrong. There are two very real and practical reasons why you need to plan an exit: Outside investors want to collect their return.  Remember that equity investments are not like loans with interest. The investor sees no return until he cashes out, or the company is sold. Even three years is a long time to wait for any pay check. Entrepreneurs love the art of the start.  Assuming your startup takes off, you will probably find that the fun is gone by the time you reach 50 employees, or a few million in revenue. The job changes from creating a “work of art” to operating a “cookie cutter.” In three to five years, you will be anxious to start a new entity, with new ideas and spinoffs that have built up in your mind, and certainty that you can avoid all those potholes you hit the first time around. If your startup was less than a success, you’ll definitely want to erase it from memory. So here are the most common exit strategies and considerations these days for planning purposes: Merger & Acquisition (M&A).  This normally means merging with a similar company, or being bought by a larger company. This is a win-win situation when bordering companies have complementary skills, and can save resources by combining. For bigger companies, it’s a more efficient and quicker way to grow their revenue than creating new products organically. Initial Public Offering (IPO).  This used to be the preferred mode, and the quick way to riches. But since the Internet bubble burst in the year 2000, the IPO rate has declined every year until 2010, and is now at about 15%. I don’t recommend this approach to startups these days. Shareholders are demanding, and liability concerns are high. Sell to a friendly individual.  This is not an M&A, since it is not combining two entities into one. Yet it’s a great way to “cash out” so you can pay investors, pay yourself, take some time off, and get ready to have some fun all over again. The ideal buyer is someone who has more skills and interest on the operational side of the business, and can scale it. Make it your cash cow.  If you are in a stable, secure marketplace, with a business that has a steady revenue stream, pay off investors, find someone you trust to run it for you, while you use the remaining cash to develop your next great idea. You retain ownership and enjoy the annuity. But cash cows seem to need constant feeding to stay healthy.  Liquidation and close.  Even lifetime entrepreneurs can decide that enough is enough. One often-overlooked exit strategy is simply to shutdown, close the business doors, and liquidate. There may be a natural catastrophe, like 9/11, or the market you counted on could implode. Make rules up front so you don’t end up going down with the ship. To some, an exit strategy sounds negative. Actually, the best reason for an exit strategy is to plan how to optimize a good situation, rather than get out of a bad one. This allows you to run your startup and focus efforts on things that make it more appealing and compelling to the short list of acquirers or buyers you target. The type of business you choose should depend on your goals, and the way you grow it should be aligned with your exit strategy. Don’t wait till you are in trouble to think about an exit, rather think of it as a succession plan, or a successful transition.

How Roadmap Week helps us turn big ideas into reality,https://wavelength.asana.com/work-plans-high-level-objectives-roadmap-week/#close,"When Asana was a young company of just a few people, we experienced a phenomenon that’s common with early-stage startups. Just about every day, someone would come to work with a new idea. (A good idea, no less!) Most of the time, we said, “let’s do it.” Until we got distracted by the next new idea.

On the one hand, it’s hard to make meaningful progress when you’re constantly open to changing strategy. On the other hand, rejecting all new ideas is the opposite of fostering the kind of organization that can learn, adapt, and react quickly.

That’s why setting aside time to make meaningful, structured work plans—and then carrying out those plans—is so important. At Asana, we consider the planning process to be just as critical as the execution process. You wouldn’t run a race without a route. Similarly, it’s difficult to run an organization without mapping out clear goals.

Sketching out a roadmap

There are many ways to do planning. After years of prototyping our own systems, we’ve landed on a model that works well for us, and that may work well for you too. We structure our calendar into ~4-month periods we call “episodes.” During each episode, we stick to our plans. As new ideas come up, we write them down and table them for later.

In between each episode, we hold a weeklong event called Roadmap Week. Roadmap Week is when we reflect, integrate new ideas, and plan just how we’ll carry them out. The whole company comes together for both high-level reflection on how the last episode went, and high-level planning on how the next episode should go. It’s a time to dream big and review all those ideas we wrote down over the past few months. Large strategic pivots are now on the table.

The week is driven forward by committees that facilitate a series of meetings focusing on everything from deployment and scalability to metrics and design. We take an honest look back on our successes and failures, discuss our goals and deliverables, map out the next episode’s key milestones, and envision new ways to experiment. Because we consolidate many meetings into that week, we have fewer meetings throughout the rest of the year.

Sometimes people say, “I don’t have time to do these kinds of planning exercises.” We’ve found that we don’t have time not to do these exercises. Without a clear plan, you might find yourself running a race without a route—perhaps quickly, but in the wrong direction.

Ultimately, organizations exist to accomplish goals. Succeeding at those goals comes down to being clear about exactly what you’re trying to accomplish (“clarity of purpose”) and how you’re going to get there (“clarity of plan”).

Here are some of the major ways we’ve benefited from implementing Roadmap Weeks.

Learn from your failures.

We look carefully at our ideas and goals set forth during our previous Roadmap Week, and inevitably, many of them won’t have come to fruition. That’s okay: You can often learn more from failures than successes. Deconstructing where, and why, something went wrong gives you the chance to both identify warning signs and avoid similar courses of action in the future.

But also from your successes.

Of course, it’s just as important to recognize and celebrate our achievements so we can replicate them elsewhere. Looking at how ideas were implemented successfully means we can use similar approaches that will lead to more successes.

Lean into big, bold ideas.

Roadmap Week is our chance to look at all of the big ideas that came up during an episode, and evaluate them objectively. In the course of an episode, I personally will generate five new big directions we could take the product; they all look great when they’re shiny and new, but by the time Roadmap Week rolls around, only one of them will seem actually worth pursuing. Once we identify the ideas that have staying power, we sketch out a realistic work plan, and put individual next steps in Asana.

Collaborate with teams that otherwise wouldn’t work together.

Roadmap Week is an opportunity to bring together individuals from teams that don’t normally interact day-to-day. It’s a chance to hear from people from different parts of the company, who might have ideas about areas they don’t normally work on. For example, often a product team will present an idea for a feature, and someone from our customer success team will be able to correct their assumptions about what customers actually want from the feature.

Anticipate problems.

In mapping out how to execute a goal, it’s worth brainstorming all the potential roadblocks that could impede you. These obstacles can often be gleaned from past failures. Other times, they’re determined by vividly imagining just how certain scenarios will play out. “Pre-morteming” is surprisingly effective: Pretend it’s four months from now, and the project has failed; what went wrong?

Capitalize on collective energy.

Roadmap Week is not only a reset; it’s a time for teammates to come together, celebrate all you’ve accomplished, and enjoy the freedom of open-ended creative exploration. Ideas produce inspiration, and inspiration produces dopamine ;-). It’s a pleasure to harness the collective passion and excitement that comes out of dreaming big, together.

If you’re interested in building a framework to create your own Roadmap Week, read our guide to forming successful committees that host productive planning meetings."

Sprint: Monday,https://library.gv.com/sprint-week-monday-4bf0606b5c81,"Sprint: Monday - GV Library Sign in Get started Design Product Management Hiring Interviews Sprint: Monday John Zeratsky Follow Apr 16, 2016     ·       4    min read On Monday, you’ll kick off your sprint by sharing knowledge, understanding the problem, and choosing a target for the week’s efforts. With only five days, it might seem crazy to spend an entire day talking and writing on whiteboards. But if you don’t first slow down, share what you know, and prioritize, you could end up wasting time and effort on the wrong part of the problem. Monday’s structured discussions create a path for the sprint week. In the morning, you’ll  start at the end  and agree to a long-term goal. Next, you’ll make a  map  of the challenge. In the afternoon, you’ll  ask the experts  at your company to share what they know. Finally, you’ll pick a  target:  an ambitious but manageable piece of the problem that you can solve in one week. Of course,  the  Sprint  book is the most complete guide  to Monday’s exercises and the rest of the week. But we’ve included the complete Monday checklist and some tips for the facilitator below. We’ve also got a video where Jake and I explain what happens on Monday and show some examples. If you have questions, check out the  live chat Q&A  we hosted during  Sprint Week . If you don’t find answers, feel free to tweet us at  @GVdesignteam . And finally, here is that checklist we promised! Checklist for Monday Note: Schedules are approximate. Don’t worry if you run behind. Remember to take breaks every sixty to ninety minutes (or around 11:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. each day). 10 a.m. ❏  Write this checklist on a whiteboard.  When you’re done, check off this first item. See how easy that was? Keep checking off items throughout the day. ❏  Introductions.  If some people don’t know one another, do a round of introductions. Point out the Facilitator and the Decider and describe their roles. ❏  Explain the sprint.  Introduce the five-day sprint process (you can use the  slide deck on thesprintbook.com ). Run through this checklist and briefly describe each activity. 10:15-ish ❏  Set a long-term goal.  Get optimistic. Ask: Why are we doing this project? Where do we want to be in six months, a year, or even five years from now? Write the long-term goal on a whiteboard. (Read more on page 55 in  Sprint .) ❏  List sprint questions.  Get pessimistic. Ask: How could we fail? Turn these fears into questions you could answer this week. List them on a whiteboard. (p. 57) 11:30-ish ❏  Make a map.  List customers and key players on the left. Draw the ending, with your completed goal, on the right. Finally, make a flowchart in between showing how customers interact with your product. Keep it simple: five to fifteen steps. (p. 65) 1 p.m. ❏  Lunch break.  Eat together if you can (it’s fun). Remind your team to choose a light lunch to maintain energy in the afternoon. There are snacks if you get hungry later. 2 p.m. ❏  Ask the Experts.  Interview experts on your sprint team and guests from the outside. Aim for fifteen to thirty minutes each. Ask about the vision, customer research, how things work, and previous efforts. Pretend you’re a reporter. Update long-term goal, questions, and map as you go. (p. 71) ❏  Explain  How Might We  notes.  Distribute whiteboard markers and sticky notes. Reframe problems as opportunities. Start with the letters “HMW” on the top left corner. Write one idea per sticky note. Make a stack as you go. (p. 73) 4-ish ❏  Organize  How Might We  notes.  Stick all the  How Might We  notes onto a wall in any order. Move similar ideas next to one another. Label themes as they emerge. Don’t perfect it. Stop after about ten minutes. (p. 79) ❏  Vote on  How Might We  notes.  Each person has two votes, can vote on his or her own notes, or even the same note twice. Move winners onto your map. (p. 80) 4:30-ish ❏  Pick a target.  Circle your most important customer and one target moment on the map. The team can weigh in, but the Decider makes the call. (p. 87) Key Ideas Start at the end.  Start by imagining your end result and risks along the way. Then work backward to figure out the steps you’ll need to get there. (p. 53) Nobody knows everything.  Not even the Decider. All the knowledge on your sprint team is locked away in each person’s brain. To solve your big problem, you’ll need to unlock that knowledge and build a shared understanding. (p. 70) Reframe problems as opportunities.  Listen carefully for problems and use “How might we” phrasing to turn them into opportunities. (p. 74) Facilitator Tips Ask for permission.  Ask the group for permission to facilitate. Explain that you’ll try to keep things moving, which will make the sprint more efficient for everyone. (p. 89) ABC: Always be capturing.  Synthesize the team’s discussion into notes on the whiteboard. Improvise when needed. Keep asking, “How should I capture that?” (p. 89) Ask obvious questions.  Pretend to be naive. Ask “Why?” a lot. (p. 90) Take care of the humans.  Keep your team energized. Take breaks every sixty to ninety minutes. Remind people to snack and to eat a light lunch. (p. 90) Decide and move on.  Slow decisions sap energy and threaten the sprint timeline. If the group sinks into a long debate, ask the Decider to make a call.

 The role of the agency business development executive has been called the "" most dangerous job in an agency ,"" due to the short lifespan, stress, and confusion surrounding the responsibilities of the role. 
 Yet, it is one of the most important positions in the agency. The success of the business development person directly influences future growth and stability. more 
 HubSpot Call-to-Action Code  [if lte IE 8]><div id=""hs-cta-ie-element""></div><![endif]  end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code  They get hired for having strong professional qualities -- leadership skills, organizational mindset, creative thinking -- that would make them competent candidates for managing the intense pressure. But having those skills is not all the role entails. Too often, agency leaders develop unrealistic expectations for the person taking on the duties, who may not have the qualities a good executive needs. 
 Agency leaders want someone with an enviable Rolodex who can bring in client accounts without much effort, in addition to being able to write proposals, market the agency, prospect, manage accounts when necessary, and command the respect of the team. This unrealistic view of what the agency wants in a person and the type of people actually looking to work in a sales role for the agency sets up the relationship for failure. 
 According to the  Marketing Agency Growth Report 2018 , 35% of agencies struggle to find employees who are the right fit for the position and 12% of agencies feel one of their biggest struggles is retaining employees. To prevent high turnover in the position and to better understand what really makes a successful business development professional, consider screening business developer professionals for these key business development skills: 
 
 
 
 Business Development Skills 
 
 
 Understands People's Buying Patterns and Trends Believes in Inbound Marketing Asks Great Questions and Listens Intently Sets Goals and Develops Action Plans Is the Right Type of Salesperson for the Role Possesses a High Curiosity Quotient Ability to Build a Brand Sets Realistic Expectations with Clients In-Depth Knowledge of the Agency Business 
 
 
 
 
 
 1. Understands People's Buying Patterns and Trends 
 As a marketer, you know the famous stat: Buyers complete up to  57% of decision-making process before they ever even contact a vendor . With the increasing amount of information available online -- either from a brand, its competitors, or its previous customers -- buyers are more educated than ever before. 
 But does your salesperson know and understand the implications of this? Once upon a time, the seller had control of the information. Now, they need to serve as an advisor who can personalize the solution to the specific buyer and her challenges. 
 Business development professionals need to be able to be well-versed in strategies that will help them build trust with a buyer and move the person through the sales cycle through education and qualification. 
 David C. Baker of  ReCourses  emphasizes that you need to hire someone who understands this consultative selling approach. 
 ""Seldom do sales people with a successful background in transactional selling make the transition to consultative selling,"" he said. ""The process and selling points and presence are completely different. For example, a transactional seller will drive the process to close a sale even if profitability is sacrificed in order to accomplish that. A consultative seller is more patient and might close three to five new substantial clients every year. Their ego doesn't require constant stroking."" 
 2. Believes in Inbound Marketing 
 Many agencies still rely on cold calling and emailing, referrals, and networking to generate quality leads. While these can be a valuable source of business development, the best sales reps understand the role of marketing in attracting, qualifying, and nurturing the very best prospects They buy into the idea of inbound marketing and understand that CMOs and executives aren't waiting around for an agency to approach them. They are in charge. 
 Michael Gass, founder of  Fuel Lines , frequently cites a stat from a study of CMOs that found that 80% of those surveyed found their vendors, not the other way around. 
 ""The recession, the rise of social media and the rapid advance of technology have dramatically altered business development. The  Mad Men  rainmaker days are over,"" Gass said. ""So before hiring someone responsible for your agency's business development efforts, in addition to the questions regarding their traditional business development expertise, you should be asking what they really know about social media, content marketing, and how to generate inbound leads."" 
 Your business development manager should support and, in some cases, drive the marketing efforts of the agency, and they should place the same value on the leads they did not source themselves. 
 3. Asks Great Questions and Listens Intently 
 ""The most successful business development people are those that can ask great questions,"" said Dave Currie, president of  The List . ""Through their professional curiosity they ask great questions and listen with intent toward identifying and truly understanding the issues, the impact of those issues to the prospect's organization in measurable terms, and the importance of solving that issue for the prospect now versus later."" 
 Prospects are already educated about your agency, your services, and the competition, so the business development person needs to be able value to the conversation, not just restate what the potential client already knows. 
 To hire for this skill, Currie's team uses two objective measures in the interview stage, an  Emotional Intelligence  (EQ) and a  Conversational Capacity test . 
 4. Sets Goals and Develops Action Plans 
 Good sales reps understanding that they need useful, meaningful goals and an established plan for reaching these goals. This helps with a few different problems business reps in agencies face. An established plan helps with clarity surrounding the person's role, responsibilities, and priorities. Without this, the rest of the team won't buy into or support a sales plan. For many people in an agency, sales is an unknown (and mistrusted) role, and if the new biz person can't drum up support and encouragement, they will struggle to feel a part of the team and find success in her role. 
 ""Business development professionals don't always get the support they need, even with well-intentioned leadership, so the ideal business development professional has to ‘drive the ship' regardless of what materials they have, without waiting or making excuses,"" said Lee McKnight of  RSW/US . 
 Before hiring a business development person, McKnight suggest that agency CEOs/owners: 
 
 Set their own expectations:  how much, realistically, can one individual can do and how much support will they need from leadership? 
 Consider the business development team structure:  Will they be the only person driving business development? Or will you create a team around this person? 
 Review the person's previous responsibilities:  Were they self-sufficient? What were they in charge of? Can they find leads, set initial meetings, and run pitches? 
 
 The business development professional should create an  annual plan  to establish business development needs aligned with finding new client growth. This will also help to prevent a common issue that causes the business development person to fail: Once sales start climbing, they are pulled into account management to handle the additional workload. The plan should reveal how important it is to make working on business development every single day -- not just when things are slow -- a priority, and it should align with hiring and capacity forecasts. 
 5. Is the Right Type of Salesperson for the Role 
 ""While sales and business development roles are both tied to generating revenue, they require paradoxically different skills,"" said Jody Sutter of  The Sutter Company . ""These days, the director of business development describes a caretaker of the pitch process and requires strengths like acute attention to detail and strong project management skills. Good business development hires tend to be people-pleasers who get fulfillment from supporting a team so that it can perform at its best."" 
 The other type is the sales-focused personality -- what Brent Hodgins, managing partner at  Mirren , describes as the ""hunter"" role for proactive prospecting. 
 ""The hunter is a more aggressive salesperson, focused on results (versus detail and process),"" Hodgins said. ""In fact, while sometimes appearing less organized on the surface, they can perform well at delivering new leads. However, someone focused on managing competitive reviews/RFPs tends to be more detail oriented and buttoned down but finds little inspiration in the idea of picking up the phone to call on prospects. Often without even realizing it, ‘pitch managers' actually resist prospecting. This is common with most account people as well."" 
 Hodgins continued: ""Agencies often attempt to have one character type take on both roles. It then fails, with the blame landing squarely on the shoulders of the business development director. The hunter is fired for not being a cultural fit and disorganized, while the pitch manager is fired for not proactively generating new leads for the agency."" 
 The issue is: Do you simply want someone to prospect for new clients, qualify, and set up meetings so that the owner/CEO can close the deal? Or do you need someone to build a team around -- someone who can create the business development strategy, processes, and be an important member of the leadership team? 
 ""Most ad agency CEOs expect their business development leads to excel at both roles and are often disappointed when they don't,"" said Sutter. 
 6. Possesses a High Curiosity Quotient 
 According to an article written by Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic in  Harvard Business Review , those who possess a high curiosity quotient are more adept at handling complexity and ambiguity -- they are more skilled in producing ""simple solutions to complex problems."" 
 This is a skill that  Peter Levitan  thinks every business development person should have, especially as the marketing and agency landscape becomes more complex and competitive. 
 ""We can train business development professionals in sales techniques, in understanding our agency's skills, and the needs and pain points of our prospective clients. We cannot, however, train people to be curious,"" Levitan said. ""That means being actively curious about our staff and culture, our industry, the client's persona and category, and importantly, understanding the true value of our sales proposition. The bottom line is that curious people build stronger relationships and that is the essence of a great salesperson."" 
 7. Ability to Build a Brand 
 Agencies understand the importance of building a brand, creating a  differentiated and meaningful market position,  and generating awareness and value around the brand for their clients -- yet they so rarely do this for themselves. And that means most agencies are indistinguishable from another: They offer the same services, describe themselves in the same way, sell to anyone, and fail to communicate their value. 
 Karla Morales-Lee of  The Art of business development  believes that hiring someone who understands the importance of brand building in attracting and selling prospects is essential. 
 ""In my experience, agencies look for all the wrong things when hiring a business development person,"" said Morales-Lee. ""Cold calling no longer works. Today, the best business development people are marketing-savvy brand ambassadors. Beyond the day to day, you need to hire someone who can build a brand externally and a business development culture internally."" 
 Business development professionals need to not only be able to define their brand but also be able to drive change throughout the marketing and sales practices of the company -- by defining an  ideal client profile  and qualifying which clients are a good fit (and which are not), marketing its firm, hiring and recruiting practices, and even determining its value through pricing. 
 8. Sets Realistic Expectations with Clients 
 A business development development rep should be well-versed in setting and  managing expectations  with prospects so your firm can exceed those expectations. This might be about when a proposal will be delivered -- promising ""tomorrow"" when it typically takes your team three days to create a proposal is not acceptable -- or creating an accurate picture of what it will be like to work with your agency. This person needs to be able to communicate your agency's values, personality, and culture to help potential clients understand what it will be like to work with your team and if your point of views match up. 
 9. In-Depth Knowledge of the Agency Business 
 While some will disagree with this, many believe that the person responsible for representing your agency in pitches or in ""get to know you"" meetings should have an understanding of the agency business and the services you are selling. Now, if the agency's owner can take over the role of a ""closer,"" and you simply need a salesperson to prospect and qualify, this is not as important. This might also not be necessary if you are willing to put in the time to train and budget to educate the person and give her a reasonable amount of time to ramp up. 
 The business development person will be helping clients not only make marketing decisions but business decisions. They should have a good understanding of general business strategies, the concerns and challenges of leaders, customer acquisition and retention, and the financial metrics that matter to executives. They have to be seen as a business advisor who can help the client to solve business problems through the services your agency offers.

    Seminar: Storytelling Power: Secrets for Exceptional Communication         Seminar: Building Better Work Relationships: New Techniques for Results-Oriented Communication         Seminar: Communication and Interpersonal Skills for Technical Professionals      
 
 Business leaders must exhibit the interpersonal and business communication skills that allow them to form positive relationships with others. And when it comes to establishing and maintaining those relationships at work and elsewhere,  one communication technique really shines—storytelling . 
 Storytelling is one of the earliest forms of communication. Before humans could read and write, they relied on storytelling to connect and share information with others. Over time, we expanded on how we transfer information to others by using written text and graphical representations. We worked to be more precise and concise, making use of models, graphs, charts, and bulleted lists. Storytelling took a backseat for a long time, recognized as a skill that only writers or performers needed to possess. 
 Having come full circle, we’re back to acknowledging storytelling as one of the best methods for getting a message across and connecting with others. Now everyone who understands the value of storytelling wants to be able to tell great stories. 
 The unconventional power of business storytelling 
 One reason storytelling has reclaimed its elevated status is that we now have greater insight into how our brains process information. We see how humans are affected by stories. As explained in the AMA seminar  Storytelling Power: Secrets for Exceptional Communication , our brains don’t distinguish between stories and reality, which enables us to experience events that don’t actually happen in our own lives simply by having them explained to us through words and/or images. The sadness, anxiety, excitement, or joy that is communicated through a story can be internalized and felt rather than merely contemplated philosophically—something that isn’t likely to be accomplished with even the fanciest of pie charts. 
 Storytelling translates into new and improved relationships by encouraging something that great relationships are built upon: empathy. Indeed, the  ability to empathize  is a base requirement for developing authentic relationships with others, and the act of vicariously experiencing the feelings of another person—such as through a story—is the very definition of empathy itself. 
 When we believe that we genuinely understand, or empathize with, another person, we tend to judge that person less harshly and appreciate him or her more. This understanding further develops and strengthens a relationship, long after a great story has been told. 
 The importance of improving business communication skills 
 Business storytelling is a great way to build rapport. Humans are social creatures, and as such, maintaining healthy relationships is an essential part of our well-being. Also, having positive business relationships enables us to be more collaborative and ultimately more productive at work, meaning these relationships have a desirable effect on the bottom line. 
 It’s for this reason that successful  companies place such a high value on interpersonal employee communication skills , and why the ability to tell a great story is recognized more and more as an invaluable business communication skill. 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
	When you develop your communication skills, you’ll be equipped to build mutual understanding and connect with anyone in your organization.

Kanban vs. Scrum: Which Is Better?,https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/kanban-vs-scrum-better,"Kanban vs. Scrum: Which Is Better? - ProjectManager.com       Skip to Content Home Features Tools Gantt Kanban Tasks Dashboards Plans Reporting Timesheets Pricing Resources All Training Videos Blog The Project Manager Blog Productivity Project Management Leadership Books Templates Guides Community Customers Support Contact About Us Login               contact Login start free trial Features Pricing Customers Resources   Menu   Agile Kanban vs. Scrum: Which Is Better? by  Peter Landau   |  Sep 12, 2017 All Training Videos Blog Templates Guides Books Software         Agile Kanban vs. Scrum: Which Is Better?   ProjectManager.com         By  Peter Landau    |    Sep 12, 2017 Should you use kanban or scrum when managing a project?  Well, it’s a trick question, because it depends on what that project is, the nature of your organization and which path is best for your team. And certainly both methodologies have their value. In fact, there are  lots of methodologies  you can use for your projects, but kanban and scrum are often debated. So for the sake of argument, let’s put them together in the squared ring, and may the best methodology win! In This Corner: Scrum! Scrum methodology  has been around since the mid-1980s, and has been a core sub-methodology of agile since 2001, when Ken Schwaber and Mike Beedle literally wrote the book on it:  Agile Software Development with Scrum. Scrum is a well-defined process framework to structure work, often used by smaller teams in what they call sprints, made up of tasks of a shorter duration, to make the project more flexible and adaptable to change. The cycles are roughly two-weeks long and led by a  scrum master , which can be, but doesn’t have to be, a certified CSM (Certified Scrum Master) position. Related:   17 Scrum Master Interview Questions to Find the Right Hire The scrum master is the team expert on the process, and they are instrumental in guiding the team to optimize the use of scrum in the project. This can be through  scrum meetings , which are held daily in scrum, but they act almost as a teacher throughout the project to support the team and give them direction. While scrum has been scaled to apply to bigger projects and organizations, its roots are in agile software development, and has come to work seamlessly in that smaller, nimble environment. That hasn’t stopped practitioners from using scrum in varying industries, from retail logistics to event planning.   And in This Corner: Kanban! Kanban  is from Japan, originating in the factories of the Toyota car company. It’s a visual way to manage workflow. The name means billboard in Japanese, and you can see why, as the process involves placing tasks on a kanban board. That way the project’s progress is clear and simply delineated for all involved. Less structured than scrum, there is no real process framework, only the model of the kanban board and the cards on it that visual represent some aspect the project. Work is organized on the kanban board as testing, ready for release and released columns. It’s used to manage work in progress. One value of using this method is that it’s easier to see the inefficiencies in the project schedule and address them before they create slack. Such advantages have seen kanban used in visual planning apps, where it can help with like storyboarding user stories and  sprint backlog planning . A kanban board in ProjectManager.com— Click to learn more!   Kanban, like scrum, is used by agile teams (and the issue of  whether agile is right for your teams  is a discussion for another time), but the method is open to any number of applications. In fact, almost any organization, or individual for that matter, can benefit from using a kanban board. The cards can represent any project phase, task deadline, team members, even ideas or whatever you can imagine. Scrum vs. Kanban: Are You Ready to Rumble?! This should be an interesting contest, as there are many similarities between scrum and kanban that make them evenly matched. For one, both are ideal for lean and agile projects, limiting work in process and favor a continuous scheduling flow as opposed to pushing through a schedule. Both are focused on delivering fast and often, work within a transparent culture to help with improving process and like to break the project into smaller, more manageable pieces. They are embraced by self-organizing teams who are continuously optimizing based on the project data. Why Scrum Process Is Better Scrum is structured. If you’re working in a project that requires more specific roles and procedures, then scrum is going to fit that bill. It has advantages because of this framework. For example, there is more transparency and visibility in scrum than even in kanban, and certainly more than in most other methodologies. That works to your benefit when you want to get everyone on the same page so they can collaborate and work as a fully integrated team. Another advantage scrum has going for it is that scrum increases team accountability. Because you’re moving quickly, you’re meeting often, at least daily. This adds to the transparency of the project, naturally, but also keeps  scrum team members  accountable for their work. That means you can reward those that are performing and help those that aren’t. Change is often a problem in big projects, which are like tanker ships, in that they take time and effort to turn. But not with scrum. It was designed to stay as a nimbler process that can pivot whenever that is called for. In fact, it wants change, or at least it can easily accommodate change. Because of its makeup, speed and tendency for small teams, scrum is also a money-saver. That’s a huge boon to startups and other institutions where the bottom line is being scrutinized (and, honestly, when isn’t it?) Problems with Scrum Scrum has come out of its corner fighting, and it looks strong, but there are some openings where it might suffer some damage. First off, it’s that scrum master. You need to have experience, and at a high level, to get scrum working. If not, you’re going to risk scope creep. Not only must the scrum master live up to their name, but the team requires a level of experience, too. If your scrum master or team are not up to snuff, there’s going to be trouble. Likewise, if the tasks are not well-defined, then you’re going to have inaccuracies. Of course, that’s true in any project, but it’ll come fast and furious in a scrum environment. Secondly, the daily those daily scrum meetings might pose a bit of a problem to your team, especially if you have remote team members or an especially large team. It can be hard to keep scrum meetings efficient over a webcam or with dozens of people, which is why scrum is usually best used by a small, local team. This is key in the scrum vs. kanban, debate, as kanban doesn’t have any team size limitations. Why Using Kanban is Better Okay, scrum has had a good round, but here comes kanban, and it’s looking good. One advantage is that kanban doesn’t require the training and experience of scrum. It’s easy to learn and understand. That’s a big plus. You can hit the ground running. Kanban is great for improving workflow and minimizing the time cycle, but it also increases the process flexibility. If you’re looking for a methodology that can bend, not break, with the winds of change, then kanban is for you. Related:   Kanban Board Software You’re going to have less waste from the process of running your project, because you’re going to see it sooner and can trim what you don’t need. It also improves the delivery flow, so you get what you want from the project, faster. One way it does that is by reducing the time cycles of the project, which again speaks to its workflow efficiencies. Kanban can be used by anyone in the project, both general team members and more skilled ones can all work on the same kanban board. Speaking of the kanban board, there are no required time boxes. So, no sprint. You don’t have to reset the kanban board as you move through the project. It flows as long as the project needs it to. Problems with Kanban Kanban is simple, so the problems that do arise tend to be associated with using the kanban board incorrectly. For example, an outdated kanban board creates problems in the development process of your project. Another issue is when teams make the board overly complex. Kanban is known for its simplicity, so to add complexity goes against the very logic for using kanban, and your project will suffer for it. The advantage of not having a timeframe can also be disadvantage. Without a hard deadline, it’s more likely that a task or phase will stagnant and take longer than it needs to. And the Winner Is… Um. There is no clear winner of the kanban vs. scrum fight. Sorry. It’s really a case-by-case contest, and even a case of potentially using both methodologies to suit different projects or different aspects of the same project. Both of these methodologies are champions of continuous improvement and as such are well-suited to tackle any kind of work. It’s up you to decide which one is best for the needs of your project and team. Now, no punching below the belt. Let’s keep this a clean project!

How to Define and Build a Great Organizational Culture in 2018,https://medium.com/the-mission/how-to-define-and-build-a-great-organizational-culture-in-2018-f8b972e433b6,"How to Define and Build a Great Organizational Culture in 2018 Sign in Get started Mission Originals Subscribe Photo by  rawpixel.com  on  Unsplash How to Define and Build a Great Organizational Culture in 2018 Beyond the keywords and catch phrases, what really works? David Smith Follow Dec 18, 2017     ·       6    min read A company’s culture is its identity. It is how the company views itself and how the company wishes to be viewed by the outside world… but, building the culture you want is not quite as easy as you may think. Simply claiming some set of values or plastering catchy phrases and core values on the wall won’t build your culture. Since people are the most important asset of any organization and hiring top-notch people can be challenging, it makes sense to look at what it takes to build a culture that attracts and retains top talent. Here we go… What is culture? The first step in building anything is to define it. Culture is a buzzword in the startup and corporate space these days… but what does it really mean? Merriam Webster defines culture as “ The ideas, customs, and social behaviour of a particular people or society .” In fact, culture was  Merriam Webster’s 2014 word of the year  (I didn’t even know there was a word of the year!) As usual, a dictionary does very little for us in helping to truly understand the depth and context of a word. Let’s dig a little deeper. Culture is dynamic… it represents both what brings people together, but also what drives people apart. It is inclusive of the things that make an organization great, but also the things that serve as drawbacks (no organization or person is perfect, right?). An organization’s culture is represented by the values which it truly lives by, not just by the words that it chooses to showcase on a wall somewhere. Photo by  Paul Bence  on  Unsplash . However, the problem with values is that they are words which represent beliefs or actions and as such different people will place different meanings to them . Take for instance the following words: responsibility, grit, freedom, hospitality, and innovation… each of these words may mean something entirely different to you than they do to someone else, based upon your life experiences and world beliefs. So, a company that chooses to define its “core values” as a representation of the building blocks of their culture inevitably will run into problems of what those words really mean and how well, if at all, the company truly represents them. Nevertheless, let’s dive into how a company can define and shape its values and therefore its culture. Shaping values, building culture In order for words to have meaning, you need to clearly define them from your own perspective. Before you go and plaster your “core values” all over the hallways and boardroom you need to determine what you want them to mean to you and to your employees. More importantly, you need to live them. So, if we look again at one of the words from above,  grit , what does that mean? Does it mean courage, resolve, dependability, endurance, resilience, or something else? Is it the courage to make hard decisions? The resolve to stick with hard decisions? Do even you want people to make hard decisions alone? Each of these questions and answers will vary based on your goals as a leader or founder. For example, I’ll say that I want grit to be a company value and by that I create a personal definition: Grit is the fortitude to face down challenges, ride the storm with tenacity, finish the job well and look forward to the onslaught of future challenges. There, in less than sixty seconds, I framed up a core value in a way that would be inspiring and motivating to employees and teams within my organization. Now comes the hard part… In order for this flashy definition to be more than just a whole sentence replacing a single word, I need to LIVE by this definition . When the chips are down and I’m the one in charge, I need to show grit as defined above… and I need to inspire others to live it as well. Then and only then does it begin to become part of our culture. Let’s take for example the  Marine Corps’ core values : Honor, Courage, Commitment. These are more than words; they are deeply embedded in what it means to be a United States Marine. From boot camp through initial training and into the fleet, Marines of every rank live the core values every day. The leadership lives the values and sets the example, instilling pride in the organization and the mission from top down… and it works! Now, you don’t need to start some crazy boot camp at the office or make employees crawl through the mud and do physical training with telephone poles above their heads to understand that, grit, for example is a value… but you do need to clearly define it and lead from the front. More than words on a wall, keeping your values As Ben Horowitz of a16z says, “ perks are not part of your culture ”. In other words, the puppy spa, the jello shots, the foosball table, the quidditch in the quad, the rock wall, the free food, the bean bag chairs, or whatever else it is that you think makes your culture so unique… is not really a part of your culture. Any company can buy that stuff and sure, it’s nice to have sometimes, but it is not a long-term intrinsic motivator to change the way that your people view their existence in your company. It is all simply a short-term “nice to have.” The only thing that will truly define your culture is by determining what your values are and holding yourself and your employees to them every single day. Culture is not built overnight. It takes patience, sacrifice and vision. It requires that leaders have the passion to improve their organization and to motivate, engage, and inspire their people with more than simply words or perks. Building strong culture takes time and commitment, but is arguably the most important aspect of your workplace. If you want to recruit, hire, onboard and retain top talent, they’ll most likely be looking at what everyday life inside your company is like and what you stand for. Likewise, it’s critical that you not only find people who fit your culture well, but people whose personal culture fits your organization well also. Culture goes both ways and as with any good relationship, it takes effort from both sides to make it work through thick and thin. In short, culture is constantly changing. It flows like water… or at least it should if you don’t want to end up working in a scene straight out of Office Space. But, this is a good thing. It allows creativity and growth to thrive. Not everything you try will work. Some things will work longer than others and some won’t work at all.  Most importantly, learn to make and stick by decisions that consistently align with and demonstrate your inner values . All else will flow from that. The reward? If you can mage to define your values clearly, motivate others to see the importance in them, and stick with choosing the hard right over the easy wrong even in times of adversity, you will build a culture that people respect and admire… and as a result, you will be able to recruit, hire, onboard and retain top talent for longer and at less cost than your competitors.

How Netflix does A/B Testing,https://uxdesign.cc/how-netflix-does-a-b-testing-87df9f9bf57c,"How Netflix does A/B Testing

Have you ever wondered why Netflix has such a great streaming experience? Do you want to learn how they completed their homepage plus other UI layout redesigns through A/B testing? If so, then this article is for you!

I’ll start with sharing my takeaways from a Designers+Geeks event I attended last week at Yelp. The two great speakers Anna Blaylock and Navin Iyengar, both product designers at Netflix, walked through insights gleaned from their years of A/B testing on tens of millions of Netflix members, and showed some relevant examples from the product to help attendees think about their own designs.

Photo from the presentation

Experimentation

I really liked this first slide of the presentation and think it’s smart to use an image from the TV show “Breaking Bad” to explain the concept of experimentation!

Photo from the presentation

The Scientific Method

Photo from the presentation

Hypothesis

In science, a hypothesis is an idea or explanation that you then test through study and experimentation. In design, a theory or guess can also be called a hypothesis.

Photo from the presentation

The basic idea of a hypothesis is that there is no pre-determined outcome. It is something that can be tested and that those tests can be replicated.

“The general concept behind A/B testing is to create an experiment with a control group and one or more experimental groups (called “cells” within Netflix) which receive alternative treatments. Each member belongs exclusively to one cell within a given experiment, with one of the cells always designated the “default cell”. This cell represents the control group, which receives the same experience as all Netflix members not in the test.” — Netflix blog

Here’s how A/B testing is done at Netflix: as soon as the test is live, they track specific metrics of importance. For example, it could be elements like streaming hours and retention. Once the participants have provided enough meaningful conclusions, they move onto the efficacy of each test and define a winner out of the different variations.

Image from the presentation

Photo from the presentation that shows the hypothesis process

Experiment

Experimentation is the act of experimenting. Many companies like Netflix run experiments to generate user data. It is also important to take time and effort to organize the experiment properly to ensure that both the type and amount of data is sufficient and available to clarify the questions of interest as efficiently as possible.

You probably have noticed that the featured show on the Netflix homepage seems to change whenever you log in. They’re all part of Netflix’s complex experiments to get you to watch their shows.

Homepage when I logged in the 1st time

Image from the presentation: the House of Cards page when seen as a signed-out user

Home page when I logged in the 2nd time

Home page when I switch the account user name

Home page when I switch name to kids

Home page when I’m not signed in

The idea of A/B testing is to present different content to different user groups, gather their reactions and use the results to build strategies in the future. According to this blog post written by Netflix engineer Gopal Krishnan:

If you don’t capture a member’s attention within 90 seconds, that member will likely lose interest and move onto another activity. Such failed sessions could at times be because we did not show the right content or because we did show the right content but did not provide sufficient evidence as to why our member should watch it.

Netflix did an experiment back in 2013 to see if they can create a few artwork variants that increase the audience for a title. Here is the result:

Image from Netflix blog

It was an early signal that members are sensitive to artwork changes. It was also a signal that there were better ways they could help Netflix members find the types of stories they were looking for within the Netflix experience.

Netflix later created a system that automatically grouped artwork that had different aspect ratios, crops, touch ups, localized title treatments but had the same background image. They replicated experiment on their other TV shows to track relative artwork performance. Here are some examples:

Image from Netflix blog, the two marked images significantly outperformed all others.

Image from Netflix blog, the last marked images significantly outperformed all others.

Check out these two blog posts to learn more about Netflix A/B testing:

How Netflix selects the best artwork for videos through A/B testing

The Netflix experimentation platform, a service which makes it possible for every Netflix engineering team to implement their A/B tests with the support of a specialized engineering team.

What I learned

A/B testing is the most reliable way to learn user behaviors. As designers, we should think about our work through the lens of experimentation.

Image from the presentation: your instinct is not always right

When and why A/B testing

Once you have a design in production, use A/B testing to tweak the design and target two key metrics: retention and revenue. By A/B testing changes throughout the product and tracking users over time, you can see whether your change improves retention or increases revenue. If it does, make it the default. In this way A/B testing can be used to continuously improve business metrics. Are your users finding or doing one thing you want them to find or to do?

My experience is that often times users cannot always complete a task as fast as you expect, and sometimes they can’t even find a certain button you put on a page. The reasons can vary: it might because the design is not intuitive enough; the color is not vibrant enough; the user is not tech savvy; they don’t know how to make a decision because there are too many options on one page, and so on. Are your intuitions correct?

Sadly, when it comes to user behavior, our intuitions could be wrong, and the only way to prove it is through A/B testing. It is the best way to validate whether one UX design is more effective than another. At work, our consumer product team have proved that through A/B testing on our real estate website. For example, they wanted to figure out whether they can make a design change to improve the registration rate for users who clicked on a Google Ad. They created a few different experimental designs and tested them. They thought the design that only hides the property image would win, but found that the design that hides both the property image and the price got the highest conversation rate. Explore the boundaries

The best ideas come from many idea explorations. At work, our product team works collaboratively across many different projects. With so many parties involved (from designers to product managers to developers), we get to explore the boundaries together. Some of the best ideas are sometime from the developers or the product managers after testing out our prototypes. Observe what people do, not what they say

When talking to users, it’s important to keep this in mind: they always say one thing but do it differently. I conducted a few user testing sessions this week and have one perfect example to show you why. I had this one user testing out a Contacts list view prototype and asked him if he usually sorts/filters his Contacts. He said no because he wouldn’t need do so. However, when he discovered the new filters dropdown menu, he was amazed by how convenient it is to sort and filter multiple options at a time and immediately asked when that can roll out in production. Use data to estimate size of opportunity

• It’s always about the whys

• Data can help shape ideas

• Check if any A/B testing are in conflict

Isn’t it so fun to be a UI and UX designer? :) Knowing your user is the most exciting part of design process! There is no finished design, but many chances for iteration to improve the design and give our users the best experience possible! I enjoy the opportunity to make subtle tweaks for our users, measure their reactions and work with the product team to figure out the next steps.

 Industry competition includes businesses that sell a similar product or service. So if you’re starting an education tech app, your industry is education technology and your competitors are other businesses creating education tech apps.  
 All businesses have competitors, and in some cases, industry competition is so fierce that companies have to fight for the business of potential customers. This is why some players have a negative view of competition. 
 A  competitive matrix  can be a helpful tool for thinking through who your competitors are and how your product or service is different from theirs.  
 Despite the negative implication of the term “competition,” the very state of industry competition can have a major influence on  business strategy .  Don’t make the mistake of assuming that you don’t have industry competition if your product or service seems truly unique.  Every single business has competition , and if there’s really a market for what you’re selling and you are on the cutting edge of something that’s never been done before, you’ll see your industry grow, and new competitors will emerge all the time.  
 Keep in mind that strategically responding to competition in your industry  isn’t just about your marketing strategy or how you’ll maximize your market share. Your strategic plan for growth should speak to competition among your suppliers, economies of scale, potential new entrants, and substitute products that could threaten your viability.

 The 5 forces that drive industry competition 
 According to  Professor Michael E. Porter ,  there are five basic forces (Porter’s Five Forces) that drive competition in an industry: 
 1. Industry rivalry 
 The first of the five forces focuses on the intensity of the current competition in the marketplace. 
 Industry rivalry looks like competitors within an industry jockeying for position, using tactics such as product launches, advertising competition, and price competition. 
 When business owners feel competitive pressure or see an opportunity to improve their current position, rivalry can become intense. Sometimes it can even lead to industry disruption. Rideshare companies like Uber and Lyft are a good example of disrupting the urban transportation industry. They have been able to leverage tech, a new pricing and delivery model, and a latent resource—cars that are otherwise sitting unused by their owners—to  capture a huge share of the taxi market .    
 2. Threat of new entrants 
 New industry players are always a threat to existing businesses. The seriousness of the threat, however, will depend on barriers to entry and the reaction from current competitors in the marketplace. 
 If barriers to entry are low (e.g. it costs little to enter the industry; there are few economies of scale in place), new entrants can weaken the existing businesses’ position in the market. 
 3. Bargaining power of customers 
 Customers can affect the pricing. Prices are affected by how many customers purchase a product or service, how significant each customer is to a company and the cost to a customer of switching from one business to another. 
 If a company has a limited but powerful client base purchasing its product, they can often dictate their terms and drive prices down. 
 4. Bargaining power of suppliers 
 If customers can drive prices down, suppliers can drive prices up. This force is driven by the number of suppliers, the uniqueness of the supplier’s product, and how much it would cost a company to switch from one supplier to another. 
 If a company has few suppliers, it becomes dependent on them and the suppliers, in turn, have the power to increase their prices. 
 5. Threat of substitutes 
 The demand for substitutes can reduce the demand for industry products and services. If a company increases its prices, customers are more likely to switch to cheaper alternatives. This can significantly reduce a company’s power within the industry. 
 How should business owners deal with industry competition? 
 Competition is everywhere. There is no way existing businesses can stop new entrants from trying to get a share of the market, but there are plenty of strategies that can help them retain their position in the marketplace or get them ahead of the competition. 
 Identify a need in the industry and satisfy it with a product or service 
 It is great to be the inventor of a specific product or service, but sometimes all you have to do is reinvent what is already out in the market. For example, as of 2017, Forbes reports that Nike is still the  most valuable sports brand in the world  in the business category, with a value of $29.6 billion. 
 The  Nike  brand first became popular in 1972 when company founders  Phil Knight  and  Bill Bowerman  invented  “lighter weight training shoes that had an outsole with waffle-type nubs for traction.”  They saw the need for a shoe that would improve an individual’s athletic performance. In 1979, the company launched its Nike Air technology and this strengthened the Nike brand further.  
 Improve on existing products or services 
 Virgin Airlines  was established by  Richard Branson  when his flight to the Virgin Islands in 1984 was canceled. He chartered a plane and offered other travelers a seat on that plane for $29. 
 Today, Virgin Airlines still offers affordable fares, full-service flights, and excellent customer service. Instead of copying what was already being offered by other airlines, Virgin offered something much better to air travelers. 
 Focus on the needs of your customers 
 Apple  has developed several innovative products and created a network of services that seamlessly work together. The company continues to provide customers beautifully designed, high-tech products that make working with electronic gadgets faster and easier.  
 Apple  makes the customer experience central  to the product design and development process by incorporating participatory design to understand customer pain points and opportunities. In addition, Apple has ensured that its computing and entertainment devices—the Mac, iPod, iPhone, iPad, and iTunes—integrate to create a streamlined, intuitive system. 
 Do not focus on your competitors 
 Do not fall into the habit of constantly checking on your competitors. Doing so will draw your attention away from  the needs of your customers . 
 As a result, instead of developing your products into something that will address your customers’ needs, you start looking at what your competitors are doing for their customers. This will be detrimental to your business and you may end up losing customers to your competitors. Instead, talk to your customers regularly—ask them what they like and what they hate about your product or service, so you can use their feedback to improve.  
 Do not underestimate your competitors 
 You don’t want to obsess over your competitors, but you shouldn’t ignore them either—that too can be bad for business. 
 In 2013,  Nokia  sold its handset business to Microsoft for $7.2 billion. At one time, Nokia had been the dominant mobile phone manufacturer in the world, but by the time the company was acquired by Microsoft, it only had  three percent of the global smartphone market .  Nokia underestimated how dominant the iPhone and Android smartphones would become over the coming years. 
 To avoid the same fate, never project future success based on current market conditions, as market players, product innovations, and customer expectations can change in an instant. 
 Competition is a good sign 
 Don’t panic when other businesses enter your space. When others want a share of the market, it’s proof that you’re doing something right. 
 Others want to get in on the same business when they notice that business owners are onto something. When your competitors copy your moves, it means you are leading in your industry. Just remember to keep developing your product or service so that you won’t get left behind. 
 Some competitors may turn out to be good partners 
 In some cases, companies that used to be competitors have learned that collaboration can be mutually beneficial. Sometimes this manifests as acquisition—one company being absorbed into another—but it might also look like a strategic partnership where two parties retain independence. 
 By looking at your competitors as potential partners and by creating strategic alliances, you may open yourself up to more business and more success in your industry. 
 
 
 
 Case study: a small business that succeeded in a saturated market 
 The party and event planning industries are saturated with players; in the US alone as of 2015, there are  129,776 party and event planning businesses .  But, this didn’t stop one former salesman from building a business from an initial “crazy” idea. 
 Iain Fox  had been working in sales but found himself feeling “very unstable” in his job and he was not enjoying what he was doing. In 2006, while on holiday with his wife, the couple played miniature golf on a course next to their hotel. 
 While there, Iain told his wife, “Can you imagine doing this for a living?” 
 When they got home, Fox came up with the idea of creating a portable course that could be used at parties and other events. He left his sales career, built the course, bought a van, developed a website, and designed a logo. On March 2007,  Crazy Fox Golf  was born. 
 When he contacted venues such as pubs and leisure centers in his local area of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire in the United Kingdom, he received mixed reactions. But his persistence paid off, and soon he started to get bookings. In the beginning, he did a bi-weekly event in a local leisure center. When people started talking about Crazy Fox Golf, more business came in. This led to an editorial coverage in the local papers which, in turn, brought in more business—this time, through corporate events. 
 When Fox tried advertising in phone directories, business opportunities weren’t as frequent as expected, but when he set up a Google AdWords account, the growth of his business increased significantly. 
 Crazy Fox Golf has continued to grow and has provided entertainment for a variety of corporate events for companies such as L’Oréal, Slimming World, and British Gas. 
 Fox started with a simple idea that seemed crazy to others but due to his persistence, his “crazy” idea is now a booming business recognized in the UK and some other countries. 
 Competition is everywhere. Businesses come and go. But consider competition as a challenge for you to improve your products or services. Analyze and strategize. A good strategy will help you compete with other industry players and ultimately get you ahead in the game.

The 10 Most Popular Startup Revenue Models
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Regardless of how good your product, service, or app is, it’s only useful when you can get it into the hands of your target customers. But once you’ve got a finalized offering, selling it should be easy, right? Not really. There are countless factors that need to be taken into account when you set out to bring your product to market, like the industry you’re in, whether you’re selling a web-based product or physical hardware, the channels you use to attract your customers, etc. 
 The Founder Institute has helped launched many profitable startups around the world. Apply to a program to a program in a city near you! 
 And that’s why we’ve prepared an extensive guide that clearly outlines some of the most commonly used revenue models startups use to sell their offerings, along with the advantages and disadvantages of each to help you pick the best revenue model for your company. 
 Business Model vs Revenue Model vs Revenue Stream 
 Before we delve into the different types of revenue models, we should spend a little time differentiating between the terms ""business model"", ""revenue model"", and ""revenue stream"", as they are very often used interchangeably. In the  GlowingStart  article, "" What Is The Difference Between A Revenue Model, Revenue Stream And A Business Model "",  Alex Genadinik  does a great job explaining the difference between those terms. They are summarized below: 
 
 
 A  revenue stream  is a company’s single source of revenue. A company can have zero or many revenue streams, depending on its size. 
 
 
 A  revenue model  is the strategy of managing a company’s revenue streams and the resources required for each revenue stream. 
 
 
 A  business model  is the structure comprised of all aspects of a company, including revenue model and revenue streams, and describes how they all work together. 
 
 
 Types of Revenue Models 
 There are numerous types of revenue models, so this list in no way attempts to list them all, especially since so many of them go by other names in the startup community. However, below are ten of the most popular and effective revenue models employed by companies, both big and small. 
 Genadinik’s article, “ Different Revenue Models ”, covers some of the more common revenue models that countless recently-launched startups use to generate their first sales. Here are the revenue models he covers below: 
 1. Ad-Based Revenue Model 
 Ad-based revenue models entail creating ads for a specific website, service, app, or other product, and placing them on strategic, high-traffic channels. If your company has a website or you have a web-based company, Google’s AdSense is one of the most common tools get ads. For most websites, AdSense will earn about $5-10 per 1,000 page views. 
 
 Advantages : Making money from ads is one of the simplest and easiest ways to implement revenue models, which is why so many companies utilize ads as a source of revenue. 
 Disadvantages : In order to generate sufficient revenue to withhold a business, you will need to attract millions of users. In addition, most people find ads annoying, which can lead to low clickthrough rates, and therefore, lower revenue. 
 
 2. Affiliate Revenue Model 
 Another popular web-based revenue model is the affiliate revenue model, which works by promoting links to relevant products and collecting commission on the sales of those products, and can even work in conjunction with ads or separately. 
 
 Advantages : One of the most obvious benefits of employing an affiliate revenue model is that it generally makes more money than ad-based revenue models. 
 Disadvantages : If you use an affiliate revenue model for your startup, remember that the amount of money you make is limited to the size of your industry, the types of products you sell, and your audience. 
 
 3. Transactional Revenue Model 
 Countless companies, both tech-oriented and otherwise, strive to rely on the transactional revenue model, and for good reason too. This method is one of the most direct ways of generating revenue, as it entails a company providing a service or product and customers paying them for it. 
 
 Advantages : Consumers are more attracted to this experience because of its simplicity and the wider set of options. 
 Disadvantages : Because of the directness of the transactional revenue model, many companies employ it themselves, which means more competition and price deterioration, and therefore, less money to made for everyone who uses this model. 
 
 
 4. Subscription Revenue Model 
 The subscription revenue model entails offering your customers a product or service that customers can pay for over a longer period of time, usually month to month, or even year to year. 
 
 Advantages : If your company is far enough along in its development, this model can generate recurring revenue, and can even benefit from customers who are simply too lazy to cancel their subscription to your company (which is the dirty little secret of a subscription-based model). 
 Disadvantages : Because this model depends so much on having a large consumer base, it’s critical to maintain a higher subscribe rate than an unsubscribe rate. 
 
 In the blog post “ Comparing Business Models to Sales Models ”,  Dave Parker  outlines the various ways that a company can sell their product or service, emphasizing how the market you pick affects the way in which you take your product to market. Here are the methods he describes: 
 5. Web Sales 
 This is an offshoot of the transactional revenue model, in which a customer pays directly for a product or service, except that customers must first come to your company via a web search or outbound marketing, and conduct transactions solely over the internet. 
 
 Advantages : Web sales work with a wide variety of offerings, including software, hardware, and even subscription services. 
 Disadvantages : Relationship sales are incompatible with the web sales model, so if your company is related to consulting or big ticket items (high-value items such as houses, appliances, and cars), you should consider employing a model that’s more suited to your offering. 
 
 6. Direct Sales 
 There are two types of direct sales: inside sales, in which someone calls in to place an order or sales agents calling prospects; and outside sales, which is a face to face sales transaction. 
 
 Advantages : Direct sales models work great with relationship sales cycles, enterprise sales cycles, or complex sales cycles that entail multiple buyers and influencers. 
 Disadvantages : The direct sales model often requires hiring a sales team of some sort, which means that it isn’t optimal for small ticket price items. If your offering is priced below the $1,000-$2,000 range, you’ll have trouble building a scalable company. 
 
 7. Channel Sales (or Indirect Sales) 
 The channel sales model consists of agents or resellers selling your product for you and either you or the reseller delivering the product. The affiliate revenue model is a good companion model to this one, especially if your offering is a virtual product. 
 
 Advantages : The channel sales model is ideal for companies who have a product that’s an incremental sale for their channel and can produce incremental profit. 
 Disadvantages : Don’t employ this model if your product requires you to evangelize your marketplace, or if your product competes with that of your partner’s, as they will push theirs and not yours. 
 
 
 8. Retail Sales 
 Retail sales entails setting up a traditional department store or retail store in which you offer physical goods to your customers. Keep in mind that the retail sales model will require shelf space (that you’ll have to pay for) at existing stores, and is best suited for products that require logistics to reach your customers. 
 
 Advantages : Retail sales is a great way to offer deals and complimentary products to an existing customer base to help boost brand awareness. 
 Disadvantages : The retail sales route is not ideal for early stage companies, or companies that offer digital products like software or apps. 
 
 In the Domain.me article, “ Planning The Expansion and Revenue Models for your Startup ”,  Sarah Green  lists even more effective revenue models for startups, including two that are based around the idea of giving something to your customers for free to help generate revenue at a later point. 
 9. Product is Free, But Services Aren’t 
 This model is unique compared to others, in that you have to give your product away for free, yet require customers to pay for installation, customization, training or other additional services. 
 
 Advantages : This model is great for building trust with your customer base and boosting brand awareness, as any company that offers anything for free will generate considerable buzz. 
 Disadvantages : Remember, employing this model means that you are basically running a services business with the product as a marketing cost. Also, a model like this isn’t always the best for scaling your company in the long term, so keep your eye on additional revenue models to utilize later on. 
 
 10. Freemium Model 
 The freemium model is one in which a company’s basic services are free, yet users must pay for additional premium features, extensions, functions, etc. One of the biggest companies to use this model is Linkedin, the most popular business/social media platform. 
 
 Advantages : Similar to the previous model, the freemium model offers something free to users, which is a great way to give them a taste of your product or service while simultaneously enticing them to pay for something later on. 
 Disadvantages : This model requires a considerable investment of time and money to reach out to your audience, and even more effort to convert free users into paying customers. 
 
 
 Final Thoughts 
 Remember to do your research, and take the time to decide which model is most ideal for your startup, as once you settle on a revenue model, especially if you’re early stage, it can be hard to pick another. As stated before, this blog post doesn’t cover every revenue model used by startups, but by highlighting the most popular ones, you should have enough information to help you pick the revenue model that will boost your startup into the big leagues.

 The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Strategic Account Managers 
 Blog    /header  
 
 Strategic account management doesn’t happen by accident – it’s made up of formalized, repeatable, and measurable processes. Luckily, like other good habits, these processes can be learned, and in time, become engrained in your company culture. 
 Here are our seven habits for highly effective strategic account managers: 
 
Execute a smooth handoff from sales to account management.  Create and refine a scripted, orderly handoff from sales to your account management team. Make sure that every new customer belongs to someone in your company and that your new customer is (at minimum) being tracked in a methodical way and, optimally, being proactively and strategically advised and engaged. 
 Conduct research.  Sift through all the intelligence marketing and sales gathered during the lead nurturing and sales process and then augment that with more research—about your customer’s business, its markets, challenges, goals, and competitors. Your goal is to figure out how you can help your customer meet their goals and solve their problems. Begin by reading your customer’s annual report and industry research about the health of their industry. Is their company growing? Why? If it’s public, what is it telling the street? What are management’s key initiatives? Pore over their website. Read what analysts have to say about their company and industry. Identify and understand stakeholder roles, responsibilities, and constraints. 
 Conduct a needs assessment.  With all this research in hand, now you can go figure out what you can do for your customer—beyond selling the product or service it just purchased. Maybe your fresh eyeballs see a potential problem looming. Maybe you have a fresh take on an old problem the company has been banging away at for a long time. Uncover all the opportunities you can to help this customer be more successful—and enrich your relationship. Your ultimate goal is to grow with the customer, not away. 
 Create a rock-solid account plan.  Write down all those great ideas in a strategic plan that your account management team hammers over and polishes to a sheen. Figure out what your customer really needs and which of these needs you’re able to fill. Make recommendations about how other companies can help or augment your plan to include complementary service offerings. We understand that you’re not doing charity work here, but putting your customer’s welfare above your own profits will generate returns to you in the long run. 
 Convert that plan into a strategic proposal.  Surprise your customer by showing that you’ve done your homework, gone above and beyond the call of duty, really taken its business problems to heart, and put your best people on those problems to come up with ideas for solving them and being more successful. Demonstrate that you’re in it for the long haul, that you value this business, and that you want the company to succeed—not only with your product but as a company. Refresh the strategic proposal at key junctures—annual planning, quarterly business review, when the competition starts to nip at the customer’s heels. 
 Establish a cadence for meeting and reporting.  Decide how often you will communicate with your customer, for what purpose, and using what venues. Be proactive. Never let your customer be left wondering when or how they will hear from you. 
 Keep the relationship crackling.  Keep the partnership going by continuing to stay up on that customer’s issues, understanding how the company is using your product, resolving problems along the way, deepening the relationship, bringing fresh ideas to the table, never letting the relationship go stale. Remember, competitors are wolves. They’re constantly coming on to your customers (just as you are to theirs). Don’t let a relationship grow stale and create an opening where a competitor can woo your customer away.

The Role of a Product Manager,https://medium.com/swlh/the-role-of-a-product-manager-e0354b4b6845,"The Role of a Product Manager - The Startup - Medium Sign in Get started Medium Things Submit The Role of a Product Manager Michael Siliski Follow Oct 14, 2015     ·       4    min read I was reading  Ben Horowitz’s book  last week, and a section on integrating new team members and setting expectations jumped out to me. Particularly expectations. Product management is an ambiguous role by nature. Most of the performance gaps I have seen over the years are directly attributable to a failure on the manager’s (my) part to set clear expectations. Same for getting high performers to seize growth opportunities–I know my own professional growth has been limited more often by my failure to recognize something additional I could be doing than it has been by a lack of capabilities to go do it. We’re in the middle of our semi-annual performance review cycle here at Google, and I think we could do better at communicating expectations to PMs. So I wrote up this summary of the role of a product manager for my team. It seeks to establish a shared set of expectations and language that we can refer back to over time. It’s what I look for in recruiting, how I gauge performance, and what I measure myself against to see where I can do better. It tells you what you need to get done, but it’s not prescriptive about how you do it. It’s also level-agnostic; as you progress, you just do more of these things, better, over bigger scope. Vision & Strategy You own the vision, strategy, and roadmap. You know the market, our users, the product, and the competition. You create innovative product plans that address real user needs. You make the right judgments, repeatedly. You tell the story of what we’re building, how we’ll get there, why it will be awesome, and why we’ll win. You drive alignment: with the development team, within the team, across teams, cross-functionally, with your manager, with your reports if you’re a manager. If I ask 5 different people what you’re building and why, I’ll get one answer. Execution & Impact You drive execution and remove roadblocks. You know where we are and where we’ll be in 6 months, and when to change those plans. You know what needs to be done now and what can wait, and you focus the team on the key priorities. You make them happen faster and better. You ensure the product is world-class. You are constantly product testing in real-world conditions. You define progress and impact, measure them, and maximize results. You convince other people to do what you need them to do for the good of the product. You drive things to closure. Communication & Visibility You are the face of the product in the organization. People bring you questions, advice, and ideas. You represent and champion the team. You ensure that everyone — your manager, execs, ops, teams down the hallway — knows who you are, what your team is doing, and what impact your team is having. You build relationships that help the team get things done. You ensure the product’s story is told, and understood, internally and externally. You create collateral, FAQs, docs, and presentations that can be leveraged by marketing, PR, sales/BD, executives, etc. Honesty & Culture You are open, honest, and fair. You build trust, credibility, and respect with the team. You act with integrity. You do not politick or backstab. You create a strong team with high morale and build camaraderie. People like working with you. You make others around you better. Ownership Your success is the success of the product. You’re accountable for devising and executing a winning plan — no excuses. I can give you a problem statement, but you’re the one who determines what your job is. You don’t get driven around by the team; you figure out what the team needs, and you deliver that. If there are gaps in vision, strategy, execution, impact, communication, visibility, team culture, team capabilities, or anything else, you own them.

One Cow Describes Eight Business Models,https://www.businessbacker.com/blog/one-cow-describes-eight-business-models/,"One Cow Describes Eight Business Models

Written by Jennifer Gueringer // Also shared on Startups.co.

Business theory can be tricky to understand. Leave it to the power of one cow to help you grasp the workings of these popular business models.

THE DIRECT SALES MODEL

A direct sales business operates through a network of salespeople. Typically there is no fixed retail location.

Examples: Avon, Mary Kay, Traveling Vineyard

THE FREEMIUM MODEL

A business under a freemium model gives away a service at no cost before offering advanced services as add-ons.

Examples: Dropbox, Hootsuite, MailChimp

THE SUBSCRIPTION MODEL

The objective of a subscription business model is to retain customers under a long-term contract and secure recurring revenue.

Examples: Netflix, eHarmony

THE FRANCHISE MODEL

Under a franchise business model, business owners purchase another organization’s business strategy.

Examples: McDonald’s, Subway, Starbucks"
YOUR BIGGEST COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES: YOURSELF AND YOUR COMPANY CULTURE,https://startupsventurecapital.com/there-are-really-only-two-substantial-and-sustainable-competitive-advantages-that-are-within-your-d0625c0fbc28,"YOUR BIGGEST COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES: YOURSELF AND YOUR COMPANY CULTURE

There are really only two substantial and sustainable competitive advantages that are within your control.

They are: 1) You (as Leader) and 2) Your Culture.

You’ve heard people say it many times: It all starts with you.

As the founder (and CEO) of a new company (talking to startup founders here, but this can also apply to seasoned CEOs) — your job is not just to focus on growing your business, you must also focus on growing yourself. This takes a deep commitment to understanding yourself — how you think, how you act, your strengths, your blind spots, and your leadership gaps. It also takes a deep commitment to working on yourself.

The more you invest in your own leadership skills (yes, it’s an investment) — the better you will be at inspiring your people, creating and seizing opportunities, and handling problems and challenges.

Here are a few things you can do to push yourself towards self-mastery and leadership excellence:

1. Implement a leadership development plan. Via self-reflection, asking for feedback and/or 360 degree reviews, determine what behaviors or skills you want to improve and then create (and stick to) a plan to do so.

2. Practice self-care. It is your job to optimize yourself for peak performance and to bring a healthy, creative, and productive YOU to work each day. Building a sustainable life for yourself and your employees is crucial to building a sustainable business.

3. Hire a coach. Growing yourself into the best leader you can be while also growing your company is hard. Having an accountability and thought partner is a wise investment.

The second, sustainable competitive advantage you can create is a strong, positive company culture. Not to beat a dead horse here, but it all begins with you, first and foremost. Leading a company is akin to being a parent — i.e. the kids are watching, and most likely mirroring, everything you do.

Even when you think no one is paying attention, they are. They are watching what you do to signal what is acceptable behavior — how they should act and interact, if they should burn the midnight oil, if they should treat Mondays like good days, etc.

There are many things that go into creating a strong company culture. Here are just a few things you can do to shape and sustain a culture that helps your employees and business to thrive:

1. Be thoughtful about your company’s core values. No copying and pasting from the websites of the companies you admire most! Have explanations for, and discussions around, what each value means, and then “Walk the Talk” as the leader.

2. Stay consciously focused on maintaining a foundation of trust. Lead from an authentic place and your team will follow. Trust in the A-team you hired and they will, in turn, trust you and each other.

3. Promote a culture of learning. Practice and preach growth mindset and develop a feedback-seeking culture by asking for feedback as much as you give it."

11 Remarkably Effective Ways to Lead by Example,https://www.inc.com/peter-economy/11-surprisingly-effective-ways-to-lead-by-example.html,"11 Remarkably Effective Ways to Lead by Example | Inc.com 
 
 11 Remarkably Effective Ways to Lead by Example   Lead 11 Remarkably Effective Ways to Lead by Example     When you walk the talk, you'll be a better and more effective leader. Isn't that what we all want?    By    Peter Economy The Leadership Guy @   bizzwriter Getty Images If you're a leader, your employees are watching every move you make. It's not because they don't trust you, and it's not because they want to keep track of your every move. The reason your people watch you closely is that they want to know if what you say and what you do are the same--that is, that  you walk the talk . If you want to gain the  trust and confidence  of your employees (and, believe me, that's something you definitely want to do), you must set an example for them. But it's not enough to set that example--your actions must be consistent with it. Here are 11 ways to lead by example--and to prove to the members of your team that their trust in you is well placed. 1. Be sensitive to people's feelings, and be kind to them Everyone has a rough day, or a day when everything seems to go wrong. Be sensitive to those times for your employees,  and support them instead of tearing them down. 2. Take time to make people feel special We all want to feel special. Take time to sincerely praise your employees for things that they do to advance your company or serve your customers. 3. Listen to people's emotions as well as words Remember that 60 to 90 percent of our communication is nonverbal. Learn to read your  employees' body language  as well as their emotions. 4. View people's needs and wants as valid Instead of jumping to the conclusion that your people can survive quite well without the things that they tell you they need and want, take the position that they are valid, and then do everything in your power to respond. 5. Choose your battles wisely Don't waste your time and energy engaging in fights that either have no consequence, or that will leave you drained. 6. Respect people's differences Each one of us is unique. Take your employees' differences into account when you make decisions that affect them. 7. Avoid being defensive--and placing people on the defensive Don't take honest feedback personally--learn from it and  use it to improve . When you provide feedback to your employees, make sure that it is candid, fair, and honest, and helps your people find ways to use it to improve. 8. Give people the benefit of the doubt No one goes to work each day wanting to do a terrible job. Assume that each one of your employees is a good and honest person who wants to do the best job possible. 9. Resolve interpersonal problems as quickly as possible Don't let disagreements or hurt feelings fester. Get these issues out into the open and work to resolve them quickly. 10. Treat people the way you would like to be treated You know how you would like to be treated by others. Now do the same for your employees. 11. Never take people for granted--never Don't forget that people are your most important asset. Give them the attention and consideration that they deserve.

 The 2-Step Facebook Lead Gen Funnel For Local Businesses 
 
 
 
 What if you could consistently and predictably generate more business? 
 You flip a switch and BOOM, a flood of new leads and customers flow into your business. 
 That would be pretty cool, wouldn't it? 
 As a local business, you're at a  unique advantage  to make this happen because you're only competing against your local competition … who likely aren't here reading this article. 
 This leaves you wide open to really crush it! 
 The Big Idea 
 You're going to send traffic from Facebook ads to a simple, 2-step sales funnel that offers a voucher/coupon for something of incredible value  (we call it an “initial offer”)  in exchange for contact information (name, email, phone). 
 You'll try to get the new lead to follow up with you first by offering a bonus if they call you right away; however, if they don't call you – you'll follow up with them via phone and/or email and/or retargeting and/or text. 
 The end goal is to get the person into your business, provide them with a great experience, and up-sell more offers. 
 Pretty simple, right? 
 Who This 2-Step Lead Gen Funnel Is For… 
 This funnel is specifically designed for small, local businesses. Brick & mortar types … where you get to actually  see  your customers and clients. 
 It  will  help you generate leads and customers. 
 Here is just a handful of businesses this works amazingly well for.  (If you have questions or wonder if it will work for your business,  just shoot me an email .) 
 
 Gyms / Health Centers 
 Dentists 
 Chiropractors 
 Masseuses 
 Barbers / Hair Stylists 
 Real Estate Agents 
 Restaurants 
 Retail 
 Live Events 
 And beyond! 
 
 The 2-Step Lead Gen Funnel 
 Here's “The 2-Step Lead Gen Funnel” in all its glory! 
 
 >>  Get This Sales Funnel For  FREE!  << 
 It should go without saying, but the images and wording need to change to fit your offer; however, the overall structure and strategy remains the same. 
 As you've noticed from above,  I am giving this funnel away for free  … all you need is a ClickFunnels account to use it. They offer a 14 day free trial, so you might as well try it out. What's the worst that could happen? You get a few leads and customers?! 
 The Initial Offer 
 On page 1, offer a voucher/coupon to claim your initial offer. 
 In the above example, the initial offer is 1 month, free access to the Crazy Eye Marketing Gym. 
 Your initial offer is important. 
 It's more important than what both your ads and pages look like. 
 If your offer sucks and no one wants it … you're not going to get anywhere. 
 And, yes! I've seen free offers bomb. Just because you slap the word “free” on it, doesn't mean people will want it. 
 Put some thought into your initial offer. Do some research. See what your competition is doing. 
 Make it better. 
 Make it  juicy . 
 You want people to salivate over your initial offer! 
 Side Note:  Your image(s) should reflect a customer receiving the benefit of the initial offer. For example, if you're a gym offering a free membership, show people working out. If you're a masseuse offering a free 15 minute massage, show someone receiving a massage. If you're a dentist and offering a free teeth whitening, show someone with a brilliant smile. 
 Side Note #2:  Don't use stock images. Whip out your phone and snap some photos of customers receiving the benefit you're offering. The “amateur” look from taking your own photos is REAL … and people appreciate REAL. 
 How Much Should The Initial Offer Cost? 
 The initial offer should be between $0 and $19. 
 Free is ideal; however, under $20 is the goal. 
 Keep your end goal in mind … get the person into your business, provide them with a great experience, and up-sell more offers. 
 If you have to “lose” a little money up front to make lots of money on the back end, why wouldn't you? 
 Initial Offer Idea Generation: Google/Yelp and Groupon 
 I created a short video to guide you through the idea generation phase for your initial offer: 
 
 
 
 Thank You / Success Page 
 Page 2 of the 2-step funnel is the “Thank You” or “Success” page. It's the page they see after giving you their contact information. 
 The first thing you need to do on this page is confirm you're sending them the voucher/coupon they originally asked for. THIS IS CRITICAL! If you don't tell them how to get what they originally requested, it causes a lot of confusion and confusion is bad. 
 The next thing you want to do on this page is try to  motivate the individual to call you! 
 It's so much nicer to have people call you rather than you having to call them and follow up with emails. 
 To help motivate people, I recommend offering another incentive or bonus. 
 What's one more thing you could offer that someone would want to grab? … 
 
 Gyms:  1-on-1, personal training session; $10 gift card for the snack bar 
 Dentists:  x-rays 
 Masseuse:  15 extra minutes 
 Barbers/Stylists:  a deep cleansing shampoo 
 Restaurants/Retail:  an extra 10% off 
 etc., etc., etc. 
 
 Just remember, it's sooooooo nice having people call you! So, make it worth their time. 
 Side Note:  No matter how juicy your thank you page offer is … most people will NOT pick up the phone and call right away. You're going to have to do some work! (more on this in a minute…) 
 Side Note #2:  I recommend using a call tracking platform like  CallRail  to help track inbound calls generated by your thank you page. 
 Side Note #3:  Sometimes there's nothing to offer here. That's fine. You can try to get people to call you anyway without any incentive. 
 Your Leads List Tracker 
 There are many ways you can track your leads. 
 You can get fancy with a CRM tool or keep it simple with a Google Sheet … 
 
 Here's a blank lead tracker sheet you can use:  Click here to open the Google Sheet .  (You will need to click “File” and “Make A Copy” on your Google Drive to be able to use it.) 
 Then, all you have to do is connect your 2-Step Lead Gen Funnel, that's built in  ClickFunnels 
, to the Google Sheet with a tool called  Zapier . 
 Here's a video on how to make the connection: 
 
 
 
 Here's the code I mentioned in the video that generates the Date Stamp: {{zap_meta_human_now}} 
 The Money Is Made In The Follow Up 
 I'm going to get real with you for a minute … 
 Most of your leads are going to sign up for your offer while they're on the crapper or at work … 
 They're typically not going to be able to call you right away … 
 They're going to finish their business and by the time they're done … 
 They'll have forgotten about you … 
 It's the nature of the game … 
 Don't take it personally. 
 You simply gotta play the game! And know … 
 The money is made in the follow up! 
 You  HAVE  to follow up with these people. 
 If you're not willing to do the follow up, don't even start. 
 Now, I'm going to show you a way to outsource it in just a minute … but, you need to understand that  following up is something  you will have to do . 
 Follow Up Strategies 
 1) Have Them Call You 
 We've discussed this one already. In an ideal world, everyone that becomes a lead will take the initiative and come to your business. 
 We try to make this happen by offering another bonus on the thank you page … but, most people still won't take any action … so … 
 2) You Call Them 
 You're going to have to call these leads or, at the very least, hire a call center to do it  (more on this in a minute) . 
 After an individual opts-in to claim the initial offer and they're greeted with the thank you page, they have  10 minutes  to call in and claim the extra bonus … so, you give them 10 minutes to do it on their own. 
 If you don't hear from them within 10-15 minutes, pick up the phone and call them. 
 It has to be that soon!  
 Every minute you wait, the lead gets colder and colder. You want them when they're hot! 
 What Do You Say To Them? 
 What you say to your new lead is simple … 
 “Hi {lead name}, this is {your name} with {your business name}. I see you just requested our {initial offer} and wanted to follow up with your real quick to {action}.” 
 Actions: 
 
 “See when you'll be coming by to take advantage of it!”
 
 If you don't schedule appointments, it might not matter when they come in; HOWEVER, by asking them this question they're making a verbal commitment to you and they'll be much more inclined to actually follow through and show up! 
 Ie. if you're a retailer … you probably don't really care when they show up; however, if they make an “appointment” to be at your store by telling you they'll be there, they will likely show. 
 
 
 “Schedule a 15 minute call with our staff so we can answer any questions you may have.”
 
 This is ideal for businesses that require a bit more “selling” before someone walks through the door, ie. a plastic surgeon. Scheduling a 15 minute follow up call is a logical step for people to take and they'll be more inclined to go through with scheduling the call. 
 Of course, when you're on the call with them, you'll “sell them” on your offering. 
 
 
 “Schedule an appointment.”
 
 Go straight for the jugular! 
 
 
 
 Of course, you can have your own “actions” and try different ones to see which produce better results. I simply wanted to present a few frameworks to get you headed in the right direction! 
 3) Email Follow Up 
 You'll use email automation to follow up with leads to, at the very least, send them the voucher/coupon for the initial offer. 
 The goal of these emails isto have them call you and/or to have them use the voucher/coupon to claim the initial offer, if they haven't already. 
 If the person calls or visits your business, stop sending them the emails. 
 Keep these emails short and to the point. For example: 
 
 Hi {lead name}! 
 Congratulations on being one of the lucky ones to grab a 1 month free gym membership! 
 To claim your slot, please give us a call at (123)456-7890 or just show up! 
 We're able to hold your slot for 3 days. If we don't hear from you by then, your slot will go to the next person on our list. 
 Thanks! 
 Nathan 
 
 Send another follow up email … 
 
 Hey {lead name}, 
 It looks like you haven't claimed your 1 month free gym membership yet … 
 And, I wanted to let you know your slot is still available for 2 more days. 
 Please call (123)456-7890 or just show up! 
 Thanks, 
 Nathan 
 PS. If you already claimed your slot, please disregard this email. Our systems sometimes take a day or two to catch up! 
 
 And a “last chance” email … 
 
 Hi {lead name}, 
 This is the last chance to claim your 1 month free gym membership. 
 If you don't call (123)456-7890 or visit us today, your slot will go to the next person. 
 Sorry to “put pressure” on you, but we only have a few slots available and want to make sure they're given to those who really want them. 
 Thanks, 
 Nathan 
 PS. If you already claimed your slot, please disregard this email. Our systems sometimes take a day or two to catch up! 
 
 That's all there is to it. Short, sweet, to the point. 
 4) Retargeting 
 Retargeting is a type of paid advertising where you can present specific ads to a specific group of people. 
 For example, if someone opts-in for the voucher/coupon, you can retarget them with ads that remind them to claim their voucher/coupon by calling and/or visiting your business in the next few days. 
 Or, if you're hosting an open house or event, you can retarget everyone with ads that remind them of the date, time, and location of the open house or event. 
 You can do a lot with retargeting and it's certainly worth digging deeper into its functionality! 
 5 ish ) Text Messages 
 You can automate text messages for follow up;  however , they tend to be more trouble than they're worth. 
 Typically, when someone receives a text, they reply via text. So, unless you want to text back and forth all day – I do not recommend this option. 
 If you decide you still want to throw it into the mix, just remember to keep it short (less than 160 characters) and have the Call-To-Action be to  call you . 
 For example, “Hey, it's The Crazy Eye Gym! Your 1 month free gym membership is waiting! Please call (123)456-7890 to claim your slot!” 
 Running Facebook Ads To Your Funnel 
 All that's left to do now is send traffic to your 2-step funnel! 
 Fortunately, there's a pretty simple formula for doing this … 
 
 Ad Text:  {Call out your audience}! {Tell them what you're giving them}! {Tell them how many you're offering}, {give them a Call-To-Action}! 
 Image:  Use the same exact image as your squeeze page background. Add text to it that says “Want {whatever you're offering}?”  (If you need help adding text to an image, check out  Canva ) 
 Headline:  {DISCOUNT AMOUNT}! {What you're offering} 
 News Feed Link Description:  Want {what you're offering}? 
 
 Example: 
 
 Simple enough, right? 
 There are a few other things I'd like to point out with regard to launching your ad campaign: 
 
 Campaign Objective should be set to  conversions . This means you need to have a properly installed tracking pixel and are tracking leads correctly! 
 Ad Set Settings:
 
 Edit Placements : Only show on Facebook News Feed and possible Instagram if it makes sense to do so. You may split test desktop vs. mobile. 
 Conversions : Set this to  Lead   (again, this assumes you have your pixel and tracking setup correctly) 
 Budget : Start at $20-$30 a day 
 Audience : Make sure you target your ideal audience and the correct location(s) 
 
 
 
 Beyond that, you can get fancy with custom audiences, lookalike audiences, retargeting, and split testing more ads and offers. But, all that's a bit beyond the scope of this post … 
 What you see above will yield you 80%+ of the results. All that extra “stuff” can get you that extra 20% or so; however, with what I've shown you, you should have no issues creating a profitable 2-Step Facebook Lead Gen Sales Funnel! 
 BONUS:  How To Setup A Call Center 
 Picking up the phone to call a new lead can be terrifying. 
 I hate it. 
 Even if you call within 15 minutes of them opting in for the voucher/coupon … they may have already changed their mind and become irrationally irate at the fact you have the nerve to call them. 
 Yes, people will give you their name, email, and phone number and then yell at you for calling them. 
 People are crazy. 
 I personally like to avoid crazy as much as possible. It's just not something I like to deal with. 
 Beyond having to deal with the crazy factor, all  these initial phone calls take time . And, you need to stay on top of them too … remember, you need to call withing 15 minutes of them opting in.  (obviously, do this within business hours. If someone opts-in at 2am, call them at 11am.)  
 If you have employees, you can obviously task them with this role … or, you can outsource these initial calls to a professional call center! 
 Jill's Office 
 A Google search will reveal hundreds of call centers you can outsource these initial calls to. Or, you can hire a friend, neighbor, or independent freelancer. 
 Do whatever makes sense for you; however, I wanted to let you know who I use and trust …  Jill's Office . 
 I have no affiliation with them whatsoever. I don't earn a commission or anything by referring you. Nothing like that. They just do good work and I recommend them. 
 To be honest, I haven't tried any other call centers because Jill's Office was the first one I came across that was US based and quick to reply. I've stuck with them ever since. 
 So, there may be better options out there, I just haven't needed to look.

 Facebook Twitter Linkedin Reddit Print Buffer Pocket    Share buttons by mashshare.net - Version: 3.6.9 Entrepreneurs work long hours and dedicate their lives to get their businesses on the right time. When success happens, it is certainly cause for celebration, but also brings new challenges! How do you know when it is time to scale your business? After all, if the business starts to scale without truly understanding who the customer is or whether the demand is sustainable, the growth can derail quickly. The Right Time to Scale Your Business While there isn’t a magic formula that can tell you exactly the right time is to scale up your business, there are many things you should have figured out before you decide to take that step. Below are a few questions that should be in the back of your mind. If you have these questions figured out, you should be in a good place to expand. “Do You Have Enough Demand?” Just because a business may be booming now, doesn’t mean it will be sustainable moving forward. One of the biggest challenges businesses face when scaling up is being able to  attract enough customers and clients to support their growth . Before you scale, you need to understand your market trends and forecasts. Put together various scenarios of what could happen to your demand once you expand, and layout how you would respond to each situation. Put a lot of thought and analysis into this. Don’t just base your direction off of emotions or assumptions. “Are Your Finances in Order?” Cost is another major concern for companies who are planning to scale. Uncertainty comes with change, and to help ease your anxiety around changes within your business, it’s recommended that you have a financial plan in place to accommodate the immediate “what ifs” that may occur. Put together some projections and simply see if your business can pay for business essentials moving forward. “Do You Have the Right Technology? Technology and connectivity both play key roles in the growth of businesses . Your business needs to have the right tools in place to ensure all systems are running efficiently and effectively. Businesses these days need solutions that range anywhere from internet and storage solutions to voice over IP and cloud-based applications. The technological requirements of a business vary greatly based on size, goals, and structure of a company. You’ll need to have a clear vision of what your business needs before scaling it forward, both in terms of functionality and cost. According to a  study by Cox Business and Forbes Insights , the largest technology challenge faced by businesses in the process of scaling is understanding changing technology needs and what products and services will meet those needs. The fear that “you don’t know what you don’t know” can be incredibly daunting when it comes to figuring out the right technology for your business. If you’re unsure where to start, consider hiring an internal IT employee that can help put the technological processes in place. If you aren’t quite ready to hire internally for that position, a  managed service  provider can be a very useful partner to lead you in the right direction. “Do You Know Your Customers Expectations?” When considering expansion, it is imperative that you keep your customers and their expectations top of mind.  Your business should revolve around their wants and needs , not your wants and needs. Spend less time worrying about day-to-day logistics and more time on connecting and innovating with your customers. After all, your business wouldn’t exist without them! “Do You Have the Right Processes in Place?” Companies are taking shape in many different forms, from standard brick and mortar establishments to completely distributed workforces. It is essential that no matter how you plan on scaling your business, you have documented systems in place to accommodate your company’s structure. Types of questions around processes to consider include: 
 
 Do you have a training process in place for new employees? 
 
 
 If you’re a remote company, how do you track employee productivity? 
 
 
 Are company goals documented for people to refer to? 
 
 
 Will you be using  cloud-based solutions  for collaboration and file-sharing? 
 
 Lastly, do you actually have a documented plan to scale your business? If not, it’s essential that you put one in place before you begin. “Do You Have the Right Team in Place?” One in ten companies is concerned with finding employees  and how the change would affect them, as well as how the change would impact customers.  Rarely can businesses scale up without hiring talent in some capacity.  You’ll need to let go of some of your control and hire appropriate people to support you as your business grows. Achieving Ideal Growth The Cox Business and Forbes Insights report  found that customer expectations and technology have the biggest impact on growth, and small business owners who get them right will come out on top. There are no shortcuts to scaling up. Once you have a strategy to scale, you’ll be in a good position to take the first step. Remember, every major company was a startup at some point. These are exciting times for businesses, and having the confidence to scale up is essential when you’re ready to take that step. By following the tips mentioned above, you’ll be ready to scale your business successfully and will set yourself up for the growth you’ve been looking for.

 Just contemplating the need to do market research for your business can feel overwhelming. However, you need to jump in because market research is key to the success of your business. First, you need to understand the difference between ""market research"" and ""marketing research."" 
 
   
 
 Market research is when you have narrowed down a  specific ""target,""  and you are delving into the behavior of that target. In other words, its research into a very narrow group of consumers. 
 
   
 
 Marketing research entails dealing with a broad range of consumers. Marketing research includes ""market"" research, but it also delves into more. The best way to differentiate the two is to understand that  marketing research  is essentially about researching the marketing ""process"" of a company—not just ""who"" they are targeting. 
 
   
 
 First, let's look at how to implement marketing research, which includes the following steps and the questions you should be asking yourself along the way: 
 
   
 
 Problem definition.  The problem is the focus of your research. For example, ""why are sales soaring in your Midwest territory, but dismal in other parts of the country?"" Data collection method and needs.  This is where you ask, ""how will I collect the data I need to solve the problem? Do I use surveys, telephone calls or focus groups?"" Determine the sampling method.  Sampling represents those you will be collecting information from. You need to ask yourself, ""what sampling method will I use? Will it be a random sampling, a sampling that contains a similar element, or a natural sampling?"" ​​ Data analysis.  You need to figure out how you will you analyze the data. Will you use software or do it by hand? Also, how accurately do the results need to be? Determine budget and timeframe.  You must determine how much you're willing to spend on the research and how soon it needs to be completed. Data collection.  Now it's time to collect all the data you have available after following steps one through five. Analysis of the data.  At this point, you conduct the analysis of the data that has been collected in the previous Steps. Error check.  Be sure to check for errors in the data you've collected and analyzed. Errors can occur in the sampling method and data collections. Create your report.  The final step of marketing research is to draft a report on your findings. Your report should contain tables, charts, and/or diagrams. It's important that your report clearly communicates the results that you found. Your findings should lead to a solution to the problem you identified in Step One. 
 
   
      3 Key Benefits of Market Research    
 
 Market research also provides many benefits. It takes the guesswork out of marketing and gives you data that you can use to drive your  marketing strategy —and accomplish your objectives and goals. It's a systematic approach that can make your marketing not only easier but more effective.  
 
   
 
 Market research includes the following benefits: 
 
   
 
 Communication driver.  It drives your communication not only with your current customer base but your target prospects as well.  Identifies opportunity.  Market research shows you where the opportunities are and helps you identify not just high-level opportunities but assists in showing you the more immediate ""low hanging fruit"" opportunities.  Lowers risk.  Detailed data keeps you focused on the real opportunities and helps you avoid unproductive areas.

 In modern  sales automation , it’s easy to make your small team of five feel like an army of 50 reps. But more volume isn’t always the answer to successful campaign outreach.

 If you have email automation and dialing tasks queued up for your sales team -- but are wondering how to turn the corner with automated outreach, this post is for you. I’ll dive into the tactics and tools used by some of the top sales campaigns out there. 
 Here’s how you can turn your sales outreach from good to great -- plus some helpful  email campaign templates  you can implement today. 
 HubSpot Call-to-Action Code  [if lte IE 8]><div id=""hs-cta-ie-element""></div><![endif]  end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code  
 1. Built-in dial analysis 
 What separates the best calls on your team from the worst? If the answer doesn’t jump to mind right away, you have a problem. It’s important to know the calls that get demos and deals vs. those ending with upset prospects or hang ups. 
 Dial analysis tools like  Rambl  answer this question for you. You can see when certain topics are coming up (i.e., competition, budget, and timeline) and monitor for certain keywords (i.e., cost, specific features, and point points). 
 One of the best features of dial analysis is that it gives each of your reps the ability to see their performance from the perspective of listen time and follow up. Sales leaders also receive full access to analytics, so they can make changes on the fly. 
 Head of Sales Andrew Johnson says, ""Dial analysis gives me visibility into the conversation quality my reps are having on the phone. With this information, I can see calls are qualified and whether our call playbook is working. Our reps love it too -- it’s streamlined their process, so they spend more time on calls and less on data entry and logging calls in our CRM."" 
 2. Automatic contracts 
 Are your SMB reps spending too much time on the wrong prospects? Deals that will never have an average revenue per account (ARPA) worth your time can still add value to your company -- but you don’t want to use account executives on unprofitable accounts. 
 What if certain leads could self-select into your closing process? Tools like  PanaDoc  enable you to add lightweight contracts right into your workflow. This lets your reps focus on larger, more complex deals and relies on a low-touch/no-touch model to bring in SMBs. 
 With auto-contract sending as part of your workflow, you can have certain customer types (those that raise their hands) pinged with the right information to make a buying decision when and where it’s convenient. 
 Additionally, these tools enable you to send one-pagers and PDF content as part of your workflow. 
 3. Hand raises 
 How does your team handle content engagement? When a prospect engages with an email -- you usually know it’s done its job. Once you get the prospect on your website, it’s time to get your BDR team engaged. 
 Dialing a prospect after they’ve self-selected (i.e., clicked on your content which signals they deem it relevant) gives you the opportunity to connect with a prospect at the right time in the buying cycle. 
 This can be achieved by using text alerts on  HubSpot Sales . A text alert can be set to notify the campaign owner any time a prospect performs a certain action. 
 For example, if someone clicks your email and visits the pricing page, you might trigger a text alert to the relevant BDR, so they connect with the prospect to field questions and qualify the opportunity. 
 4. Direct mail campaigns 
 What do you do when leads don’t respond; Put them back into a nurture drip campaign? Before throwing in the towel, give your contact one last push through a new channel. 
 Direct mail has come back into the forefront in recent years as a great way to get through all of the noise prospects have in their inbox. How can you get direct mail to tie in to your sales automation? 
 Tools like  Inkit  make it easy to automate direct mail helping companies leverage exploding offers and promos to the tune of a 8.9% redemption rate. That makes for one nice revenue boost. 
 These systems integrate directly with your outreach cadence,  your HubSpot CRM , and your other conversational commerce channels (i.e., chat). 
 5. Automated email sales campaigns 
 Brandon Redlinger , director of growth at  Engagio , says, “Marketing automation is perfect for nurturing campaigns and email newsletters. But when it comes to sales -- especially if you’re doing targeted account selling --  pure automation is dangerous .” 
 There are too many moving pieces in top-of-funnel sales, and Redlinger says if you mess them up, you instantly lose the trust of your prospects and will be condemned to the spam folder. 
 He preaches the importance of coupling an understanding of the dangers of too much automation with a powerful platform that streamlines the personal elements of your outreach efforts. Here’s Redlinger’s strategy for creating the perfect  automated email prospecting  strategy. 
 Create Your Campaign Templates 
 For your first warm outreach email, follow these guidelines to boost your chances of getting a reply: 
 
 Keep it short:  People don’t have much time to read, let alone respond to your email. Aim for no more than three to five sentences. 
 Open strong:  Mention a common professional connection or interest, offer congratulations on a new job or award, or send a relevant piece of content. 
 Offer a compelling value proposition:  Distill the value of your product into one sentence. 
 Include a call to action:  What action do you want your prospect to take next? Ask a specific question or give them instructions on how to follow up. 
 Sound like a real person:  Remember,  people want to connect with other people . Buyers are much more inclined to answer an email that says "" Hey prospect, did you have a chance to check the whitepaper I sent? Let me know! ” than one saying “ Dear Mr. Prospect, I would like to cordially invite you for a brief demonstration of our product. Sincerely, Mr. Salesman. ” 
 Choose a relevant subject line:  Don't slap on a completely irrelevant subject line. 
 
 Here’s a template for your first  warm outreach email campaign . 
 
 [Your Company] > [Prospect’s Company] 
 
 Hi [First name], 
 I saw on LinkedIn that we’re connected through [common connection. [Write one sentence about why that connection is relevant]. 
 Given your position, I think you might be interested in what my company does. [Give your one or two sentence value proposition]. 
 Are you free for a 15-minute call this Thursday or Friday? I’d love to see if I can help. 
 Thanks, 
 [Your name] 
 
 
 
 Subsequent touchpoints should not be “ Just checking in, "" or “ Wanted to follow up. ” Instead, formulate a legitimate reason for following up. Here are four great reasons to follow up that will make you a welcome guest instead of an annoying pest: 
 
 Re-emphasize business value:  It’s all about what you can do for them. Find a different way to show value. Talk to a different pain point. 
 Offer insights:  Share a different perspective on their problems or a novel idea for how they can reach their goals. 
 Educate:  Not every follow up should be a pitch. Instead, offer a piece of valuable content, like a whitepaper, ebook, or webinar recording. 
 Share news:  Why do you think social media is so addictive? People don’t want to miss out. Follow up with news in your industry, product updates, or news about their competitors. 
 
 After some time has passed and you haven’t received a response, a big mistake is thinking the lead is now dead. But that's not true -- it might just be a matter of following up a few more times. Here's one of my most effective follow up emails for 30+ days out. 
 
 Quick question about [pain/problem you solve] 
 
 Hey [First name], 
 Are you still interested in [Your solution]? 
 Cheers, 
 [Your name] 
 
 
 
 That’s it. 
 It gets great responses. Some people thank me for reaching out, others politely say no. Both are valuable answers because I now know the status of that lead. 
 Set Up Your Campaigns 
 Here’s where you’ll apply a custom cadence for each campaign touchpoint. Set up different campaigns for various segments of your list. The more you can segment your list, the better your chances for a reply. 
 If you have a large list, start A/B testing different aspects of your campaign to find the best outreach plan. Here are a few suggested variables to test: 
 
 Number of touches 
 Time between touches 
 Subject lines 
 Social media mix 
 Calls to action 
 Top-down vs. bottom-up approach 
 Language and tone 
 
 Add Your Leads 
 It’s time to start importing your leads and dropping them into appropriate campaigns. If you’re using the right platform, at the end of each working day you can drop the newly discovered leads into ongoing campaigns without having to start a whole new campaign. The trick here is to make sure you don’t have the same leads in different campaigns. 
 Launch Your Campaign 
 Make one final pass through your list and templates to ensure there are no missing variables -- then hit send. 
 Analyze and Adjust 
 After you’ve given your campaign enough time to run, take a step back and see what’s working and what’s not. Hopefully you have benchmarks to compare how each touchpoint and campaign is performing. If not, don’t worry. Start tracking now so you can run a  data-driven prospecting  campaign. 
 A cautionary note:  Beware of “industry averages,” which are often inflated. Companies sharing benchmarks are usually those doing well. Furthermore, many of these companies are much further along in their testing programs. So, aspire to benchmark numbers but don’t be held captive by them. 
 These tactics and tools are all about helping your reps work smarter not harder. Sales requires a lot of volume to get results -- but that doesn’t mean more volume is always better. 
 Sometimes what your outreach really needs is better insight on what call types and content are getting the most traction. 
 Other times, it’s about adding a touchpoint and remembering not to throw in the towel too soon. Either way, the determining factor for having your sales cadence turn the corner is your ability to iterate and try new tactics. So, go ahead and drive some pipeline.

The Five Types of Virality,https://news.greylock.com/the-five-types-of-virality-8ba42051928d?source=rss----f89b20443665---4,"The Five Types of Virality

and choosing the right one for your product to grow

Every entrepreneur has the dream of making their startup’s product go viral. But too often this is couched in a naïve understanding of virality. “Let’s make our app viral!” Or your investors ask you, “Can you take your app and add a little bit more virality?” (I often hear this described as growth hacking, too.)

Sometimes it feels like people believe virality is just magic pixie dust that can be sprinkled on anything. Fortunately, it’s much more concrete than that. But to understand how virality works, you first have to know that not all virality is the same. Many successful companies have done distinct things to help make their products go viral, all in completely different ways. So I thought it would be helpful to try to classify the disparate approaches.

If you’re trying to build your company and grow your product, it helps to think as specifically as possible about how to get your product in front of people. You can engineer features that will amplify the chances that people will want to try it. Of course first, you have to make a great product that people love. Once they love it, they’ll talk about it more. But how do you actually feed them the language to talk about it and enhance that word of mouth experience? How do you remind them to talk about it when they’re having a great experience? Or later? You need to understand what’s inside your core users’ minds, and use that knowledge to help them share your product through whatever means makes the most sense.

Do you need to build incentive programs into your product and marketing plans? Or, if people are making something tangible and shareable with your product, like pictures, how do you get them to share it in a way that other people will be naturally exposed to the product? And then how do you make sure that the flow of interested people actually converts to new users as seamlessly as possible?

The most basic element common to all these different types virality is inception. The goal of all viral efforts is to insert (or “incept”) an idea of what a product can do into someone else’s head, and to get them so excited about it they want to try it and use it. That’s the most important component of any type of virality. What is that little sentence, that little hook, that little reason why somebody actually wants to try your product out?

So here’s what I’ve found are the five main types ways a product can do this. Do you have another way I didn’t cover here? I’d love to hear about it.

Word-of-mouth virality

This one is straightforward: It’s simply a product being so good that people can’t help telling their friends about it. For example, when Google was just taking off, people would notice you searching on Alta Vista or Infoseek or another search engine and they’d tell you “use Google, the search is so much better.” So the next time you did a search, you’d try it, and pretty soon you’d be telling others about it too.

A couple of years ago, when we got our first iPhone apps, geeks like me were telling everyone they knew about Evernote, because it lets you sync notes between your computer and your smartphone. It often happened when you’d see someone taking notes on their phone, and they’d tell you they were using Evernote and how simple it was to keep one copy of the notes everywhere.

One other key to word of mouth virality is making sure your product is easy to find later. Having a name that is easy to remember, *and to spell* certainly helps (Google is easier than Googol — the number it was named after). Missing vowels and doubled letters, not having the right domain name or app store name always make it trickier. One test I like to do when trying out new company names is check the typeahead in the App Store. If you are calling your application InstaGreatCoolThing, you might realize users typing ahead will see Instagram and similar apps before yours (until you are as big as Instagram).

The other key is to make sure your product is easy to describe. The words you use to describe your product — on your home page, in your press messaging, and in the product itself will be the foundation of how your users describe it. This is really important because it’s how your users will incept other users with what your product does. Funny side features like Google’s “I’m feeling lucky” or Facebook’s “Poke” often help to make the description memorable too. If you don’t have a pithy way to describe your product, you should assume your users won’t be able to either.

Incentivized word-of-mouth virality

This is similar to word-of-mouth, but with a little added incentive for people to refer their friends. For instance, 15 years ago, Paypal would give you $10 if you referred a friend and they created an account. Similarly, Dropbox and Uber have used incentives to great effect. Refer a friend and they’ll get more free storage (and you too), or a discount on their first ride.

It helps when the incentive works both ways, as a coupon for the new users as well as an reward for the referring user when the recipient creates a new account. Because you are paying for it and discounting your service, it’s not quite as clean or pure as word-of-mouth, but it can be very effective.

Demonstration virality

Demonstration virality is when the nature of a product is such that, simply by using it, people are showing it off. One great example is Instagram: In 2010 it was fairly difficult to get photos off your phone and into some useful place, so Instagram added tools for people to easily share their photos out to Twitter, Facebook, and Flickr. Instagram’s filters naturally caught people’s attention on those networks. It provoked an instant “How did you do that?” reaction.

You can see Prisma blowing up this summer in the same way. You can create these incredible, stained-glass-like artworks with it, and then share them on Instagram or wherever. Of course people want to know how did you did that, so they’ll ask you — or they can see the little Prisma logo on the image, and then go get the app themselves.

Musical.ly spreads in a similar way as users and influencers create very cool music videos and then share them on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and people decide to try Musical.ly to make their own.

Another example is Pinterest. If I create a pinboard of fun GIFs or wedding ideas or recipes, and I share it, the act of sharing is a built-in advertisement for Pinterest’s awesomeness.

Even Uber benefited from demonstration virality early on. You’d show up to a meeting in a black car and people would be like, “Dude, where did you get the limo?” Or you’d be leaving a party and you’d just press the Uber button and a car showed up for you. Meanwhile, your friends were trying to hail cabs or call for rides. Just by using Uber, you were a walking advertisement for the product and how much better it was.

Infectious virality

Infectious virality is when a product is designed in a way that people will work to get other people using it because it will make it better for both of them. It’s when one user is “infecting” another with the virus, I mean the product so that they are both hooked. For example, Snapchat users have a big incentive to encourage their friends to download Snapchat so they can send photos back and forth in a more authentic and safe way. Twitter works the same way: If you follow me on Twitter I’ll have more followers, and you can see what I’m doing and tweeting, and it’ll be great for both of us. Nextdoor is a really interesting example where even though people might not know their neighbors, they can send them postcards to invite them and make the neighborhood community larger and more productive for everyone. And of course LinkedIn and Facebook are the canonical examples of infectious virality where people invited you to be their colleagues or friends on the service.

Invitations are the key to spreading infectious virality. However — false invitations or overly spammy invitations often have a deleterious effect on virality. When someone invites you to a service only because they invited their entire address book, it doesn’t feel personal or connected. And if you sign up and the person doesn’t even use the product, then the likelihood for the next person to become active diminishes greatly.

This is what most people think of as classic virality, because it’s how we’ve seen social networks and communication networks spread. And who doesn’t love the special feeling of being “invited” to a product by their friend? But infectious virality doesn’t and shouldn’t apply to all products. Being invited into a product that isn’t naturally social doesn’t really work. So use this method carefully and make sure it really applies to your product.

Outbreak virality

Finally, some things just spread because they’re fun to share, or because they’ve got a lot of popular momentum and people want to look cool by sharing them. YouTube videos blow up because they’re funny, or addictive, and it’s just fun to share them with your friends.

In a similar way, Pokémon Go took off this summer in part because everyone was doing it, and it was just fun to tell your friends about it and to participate yourself. Of course, there are other aspects to this game’s success, such as the fact that it was leveraging a very established, beloved brand, but it also benefited from this virtuous circle of fun, popularity, and sharing.

Putting it all together

When you understand the different tools and that they all work differently, you can design or build virality into your product in a way that’s very natural.

I often see founders saying something like, “I’m just going to add an invite flow to my product.” That doesn’t work in most cases. If it’s not well positioned and well integrated, an invite flow is just going to produce a bunch of ineffective invites that won’t convert into new users. It might just bring in a bunch of transient users who don’t stick around. You don’t want to try infectious virality unless it really is applicable — that you want each user to bring another user into the product experience so that it will be better for both of them. If your product is about creating content or having experiences that are easy to show off, it’s often much better to focus on demonstration virality. And if your product costs money and has value, an incentivized word of mouth strategy can really pay off.

When you successfully create that moment of inception, and get the idea of your product into someone’s mind, you do need to follow that up with a smooth new-user flow. The person who shows up to your website or the App Store is ready to try it. They are excited to try it and give your product some attention. This is your best chance ever to get them to learn more about what the product does and get it set up for their value. You need to start the onboarding process right so the product has a chance to become a habit, and then for that user to spread it to the next set of people.

It’s entirely possible to have mass deception, where you find a good growth hack and get a bunch of people show up and try your product quickly. But if you’ve enticed them for the wrong reason, they don’t actually adopt the product, or if they do, they don’t stick around long enough to feed the next round of viral adoption. So whenever you’re thinking about engineering virality, you need to be sure that it’s reaching the right people, gets them interested for reasons that align with the intrinsic value of your product, and leads them to the right actions.

I still remember when I was first invited to Snapchat. A friend texted me to join them so we could send funny faces back and forth and they would be deleted. When I joined up, the first thing he did was send me a funny face and we ended up having a lot of fun with it. The viral hook connected directly with my first use. Over time we learned to send a lot more types of communication together and added more and more friends and it took off. But if Snapchat had offered free beer to everyone who signed up for Snapchat, they might have driven a lot of new users even faster, but those people would all be gone as soon as they finished the beer.

Remember, at the end of the day, there’s only one metric that really matters: How many people are actually using your product. Not downloading it, not clicking on it, not trying it for a day. Actually using it. So your viral techniques all need to be aligned toward the goal of increasing the number of actual users."

Their mission is to help every student realize their full potential through the best fit education their money can buy. While their focus is on students with the College Factual brand, they also have other brands like Ed.ai (for advisors), Educate.ai (for colleges), and BRIGHT HUB (for teachers).

In Josh’s Product Tank NYC presentation, he explains his evolution as a product manager. His roles over the last 15 years have started with engineering and architecture, and moved on from there to product management, and now he oversees product, but also data science, engineering, and UI/UX teams. His current role is best identified as Chief Operating Officer.

What is a Product Manager?

Josh openly admits that he has struggled at times to truly define the role of product manager. In fact, many people, both outside and inside the product community also struggle with this reality. Knowing that the product manager role is dependent on one’s career background and skills and the industry that one works (among other things), Josh has gone through many different ideas of what product managers should do.

Build More Product

Josh first assumed that his primary responsibilities involved satisfying his stakeholders and releasing lots of features. The problem with that definition, however, was that he had no validation process in place, and his technical focus caused him to ignore things such as marketing. He found himself being angry with stakeholders for failing to validate product ideas, despite doing exactly what he was told. He then realized that while his stakeholders may ask for certain things, his responsibility is to know what will or will not succeed.

Build the Right Product the Right way

Next, Josh began to think about his effectiveness as a product manager more often. He focused on the product-market fit and user testing. At first, things began to work very well. But after a while, he started to realize that product success leads to managing more products, until eventually you start to lose control and become a bottleneck. Deadline pressure leads to making shortcuts, and you find yourself going from being a leader or coach on the team, to being a dictator, which can create friction on a team. Josh learned from his experiences with this that he needed to become scalable.

Josh discovered that once you start to focus on scalability, the other areas start to work themselves out. You need to start investing in things like systems, automation, feedback loops, and metrics dashboards.

How do you Become a Truly Scalable Product Manager?

Josh’s short answer to that question is: “you can’t.” To be truly scalable, you can’t be a product manager; you need to be a product leader. To become a product leader, you need to start letting things go and sharing them with the rest of your team. Josh explains that many product managers become hoarders of things like:

Vision . A product manager creates and shares their grand vision with the team, whereas a product leader creates a shared vision with the team, and continues to evangelize it.

Users. Product managers regularly talk to users, whereas product leaders ensure that the entire team is regularly talking to users.

Learning. Products managers are always learning, whereas product leaders are always teaching.

Answers. Product managers give the right answers, whereas product leaders ask the right questions.

Decisions. Product managers make all of the decisions, whereas product leaders delegate all of the decisions.

Power and Control. Product managers retain power and control, whereas product leaders distribute power and control.

Efforts. Product managers’ direct efforts of those in their company, whereas product leaders inspire efforts of those in their company and beyond.

In his conclusion, Josh reminds us that being a product leader is a matter of combining effectiveness and scalability. You need to be building the right products, but also building them the right way and thinking large scale and outside the conventional ways of getting things done. Being a leader is also very much about being a member of your team, rather than overseeing your team. Product managers create products, but product leaders create “movements” or experiences.

 A Mental Model & Framework You Can Use For New Products, Existing Products, and  Even  PM Interviews In this series… Part 1:  WTF is a Metric?  —  introduction to the basics of metrics, what it is, and why it matters. Part 2: 4 Steps to Defining GREAT Metrics for ANY Product — how to develop a metric from scratch. Part 3:  WTF is Your Metric Doing to Your Customers?  — how to avoid the unintended consequences of the “one metric that matters.” M etrics matter. Your product’s success is dependent on and defined by metrics. Metrics are a lens into your product’s health and performance. Defining your metrics, therefore, should be as intrinsic to your product development process as defining requirements. In fact, metrics are one of the most frequently asked product manager interview questions: How would you define the success metric for feature X? The Challenge Developing metrics from scratch can be incredibly daunting, precisely because there is so much at stake. Unless you work in an industry where standard metrics are widely accepted (such as in gaming, e-commerce, or retail), metrics are anything but trivial. Many product managers start bottom-up: monitoring and collecting the near-infinite number of data points they can get a hold of. However, an obvious truth quickly begins to surface… …not all data are created equal. Just because you can track everything doesn’t mean you should.  Some data are more valuable than others  because they give you a unique insight into your product’s health. Conversely, there is a lot of subpar data that can cloud your judgement. A Mental Model for Metrics Let’s step back. Think about your product as a box: You can start to instrument this box and collect all available data, but this can become an aimless approach characterized by constant trial-and-error. In order to build a product your users value, you first need to determine the inputs and outputs of this box. Your inputs are anything your users come to you with: their problems and their resources. Your outputs are the circumstances resulting from the use of your product. These become your  goals . But this is not a black box. Most products require the user take  actions  within the product to extract value and achieve their  goals . Quantifying and measuring these actions gives you insights into how (and how many) users are getting value from your product. When you track these actions over time, they become your  metrics . Once you start to collect data for your metrics, you can then put them to work towards evaluating your product. The results of your  evaluations  can inform any number of adjustments in your  goals ,  actions , or even  metrics  themselves. You can start to see that this very simple model can be applied in any number of ways: Defining success metrics for a  new product Determining a  new feature’s  success and impact Re-vamping metrics for an  existing product Fielding  interview questions  about metrics For each step, here’s a bit more detail on how to do this. The GAME Framework The GAME framework is a  4-step process that can define metrics for any feature or product . For the remainder of the post, I will refer to a hypothetical “product” but feel free to substitute in “feature” whenever a “product” is discussed. Step 1: Articulate Your Goals This is obvious, but you should  always start by defining your goals  for your product. Your goals are critical to ensuring that you maintain a purpose-oriented strategic mindset. They also serve as tangible markers for revisiting and validating directional correctness throughout the metrics development process. Placing goal-setting as your first step forces you to be top-down, which is critical for developing metrics. A bottom-up approach is suboptimal because it relies on intuition and can often lead to analysis paralysis. To define your goals, ask yourself the following questions: User Goals:  How will my users benefit from my product? What problems do my users want my product to solve for them? How will my users interact with the product? How will my users feel when they use my product? What is my vision for how this product will integrate in my users’ life? Business Goals:  What are the tactical or strategic business benefits? Increase revenue? Decrease cost? Be more competitive? Enter a new market? What does my business look like if my product is successful? Note that for many of the best products, user and business goals align. These goals are often two sides of the same coin. Once you have this set, you are ready to get in on the action. Step 2: List the Actions That Matter The next step is to define your user actions, or more precisely, all the actions you want your users to take within your product. This should start as a  qualitative  list. Don’t worry about the numbers or whether they are trackable yet. Here are some example questions you may ask yourself using the common ARM metrics framework. Pick the set of questions that align with your goals: Acquisition & Activation : How will my prospective users hear about my product? What actions do my prospective users have to complete to become a user of my product? What actions do my users have to take to get value from my product? At what point is my product solving a real problem for my users? Retention & Engagement : What gets my users to come back to my product? What do my users do when they are engaged with and interested in my product? What are the actions that provide my users repeat value? How often does it make sense for my users to take those actions? Daily? Weekly? Monthly? Once in a long while? Monetization & Revenue : What form of “payment” does my user purchase with, money or time? What actions do my users take for my product to start charging? If my product is free, what are the reasons my users will opt to pay for it? Do they pay me directly or does someone else pay me when my users take action (e.g. ad/affiliate)? Do they pay me for every action (transaction) or do they pay me periodically (subscription)? You can also use metrics frameworks like  AARRR  to flush out the actions. The key to doing this well is to be  comprehensive but not exhaustive : have the broadest coverage, but don’t bother differentiating the minutiae.  For example, if your acquisition user action is “newsletter signup,” don’t worry (yet) about listing each newsletter sign-up interface. Step 3: Define Your Metrics You are now ready to turn each desired user action (qualitative) into a measurable, trackable value (quantitative). Note that if you haven’t already done so, bring engineering and data teams in at this stage to vet your metrics and provide technical guidance on the feasibility of collecting/storing the desired data. Here are some major decisions for how to count each action: Direct vs. Proxy : Can the action be directly tracked? Or do you have to use a proxy to measure the action?  For example, you can measure “clicks” directly, but you may need to proxy “views” with values like scrolling. Individual vs. Aggregate : Can you group many actions for an overview, then separate out as slices for later analysis?  For example: total revenue → revenue by product line → revenue by individual product. Magnitude vs. Ratio : Does it matter more for you to measure the overall magnitudes of the action? Or should you track as a comparison using a ratio, whether it be a rate (per time) or a normalizing factor (percentage, per user, etc)?  For example, you can measure “total revenue,” or you can measure “revenue per day” and “revenue per payer,” which will give you very different perspectives on the same data. Intrinsic vs. Heuristic : Can you derive more knowledge from the measure intrinsically? Or do you have to rely on heuristics for the metric to be valuable?  For example, while “daily active user” (DAU) may be intrinsically useful for B2C apps, a heuristic like “number of paying users who were active in the last 30 days” may be more appropriate for B2B SaaS products that are expected to be used monthly. For most, this is the hardest step in the framework. Some of your decisions are informed by strong intuition, while others are informed by technical constraints or further data analysis. Often you won’t know for certain whether a metric is working until some iterations. At this stage, you can also begin to weed out  vanity metrics . Tweak the metrics that can be “gamed,” i.e. artificially inflate or deflate through clever design/engineering or malicious user intent.  For example, inflating page views by using pagination or slide shows. Step 4: Evaluate your Metrics The best way to ensure your metrics are providing you the correct insights into your product is to  test and iterate . You simply will not know how a metric behaves until you start collecting data. The most import evaluation you need to make is the functional usefulness of the metric.  You can check for usefulness by monitoring the metric for any false-positives or false-negatives. For example, if the metric drops, does it signal a real problem in the product? Conversely, if an issue surfaces, is the metric helping you flag this issue? Of course, you would also expect the metric to flag true-positives and true-negatives. Different behavior with your metrics may inform iterations in each of your GAME steps: Evaluating Metrics : Is the data trending in the way you expected? Is the metric stable over time (i.e. not wildly fluctuating)? Is the metric flagging issues with your product and prompting further analysis? Are these the correct data points to collect? If you answer “no” to any of these questions, you want to reconsider how you developed your metrics. Evaluating Actions : Are these actions reflective of product, user, or business goals? Are your key actions telling the correct story about user behavior? Does your action set cover all emerging user behaviors? Are your actions safe from being “gamed” by your users? If you answer “no” to any of these questions, you want to redefine the set of key actions. Evaluating Goals : Is the metric correlating to business or user success? Are your users happier when your metrics are positive? If you answer “no” to any of these questions, you want to revaluate how your metrics relate to your goals. Ask yourself these honest questions and remember that you are looking for your metrics to measure the vital signs that give you an actionable indication of health and performance. Applying GAME: Facebook’s Newsfeed Example Disclaimer: I have no insider information from Facebook. This section is pure speculation.  😇 The Facebook Newsfeed comes up as one of the most common interview questions, particularly because it has the right mix of ubiquity, complexity, and opaqueness. Let’s apply the framework step-by-step: G oals for the Newsfeed can be broken down between user and business goals: User Goal : I want to be able to see the latest of what my friends are up to without going to each of their profiles. Business Goal : Users are only coming to Facebook when they have a reason to: they are looking to post or they have been messaged/mentioned. We want to improve engagement by creating an evergreen content discovery experience. A ctions taken on the Newsfeed can be collected into the following qualitative list when considering “engagement” as the primary goal for both user and business: Logging  into Facebook to look at Newsfeed Posting  to Newsfeed (text, photo/video, photo/video album, live video) Viewing  Newsfeed items, including watching a video Scrolling  through the Newsfeed Clicking  on Newsfeed items (content, name/photo of the poster) Commenting  or replying to a comment Liking  a Newsfeed item or a comment Sharing  a Newsfeed item to your own or someone else’s wall (person, page, group), or as a private message Saving  a post (yes, you can  look at saved posts later … who knew?) Hiding, unfollowing, reporting, or turning off notifications  for a Newsfeed item Notice how the list is relatively  comprehensive but not exhaustive : it covers all of the bases but doesn’t try to split hairs between all the different post, click, or comment types. We can also see how product design around creating or changing actions can be a major lever for impacting engagement. M etrics is where this gets interesting. In trying develop the most useful, actionable metric, we can vet them through our various decision points: Direct vs. Proxy : Most of the actions above can be tracked directly with clicks  except  for viewing a feed item. For viewing, we may use a proxy to count the number of items viewed, such as “count viewed if 75% of the feed item is in the device viewport.” Individual vs. Aggregate : Because our primary goal is measuring engagement, we care about our users engaging with the Newsfeed in general more than any specific action, so we will define a metric with aggregate measures. With that said, some actions (like posting) are more valuable to us, so we may choose to group them differently. For example, we can aggregate Newsfeed  posting  actions into the first bucket,  viewing  actions into a second bucket, and  interacting  actions (inclusive of links, comments, share, blocks) into a third. Magnitudes vs. Ratios : Looking at the magnitude of Newsfeed action is relatively meaningless since any given user can generate a great number of actions. It is more useful if we consider either actions-per-day or actions-per-user (or both, i.e. actions-per-user-per-day). Intrinsic vs. Heuristic : Unfortunately, there’s no easy measure to determine whether someone is “engaged” or not. Let’s say a  hypothetical  analysis shows that people who  post at least 1 feed item  OR  view at least 20 feed items  OR  interact with at least 3 feed items  are 2x more likely to come back to Facebook the next day. We can use this data to develop a heuristic around an engagement metric, whereby if a user crosses any of the three thresholds above, they are considered “engaged.” Pulling this all together, our metric for the Facebook Newsfeed will look something like this…: …where “engaged user” is a  heuristic  that’s developed by  aggregating  both  direct and proxy  actions and comparing it as a  ratio  to “total users” on a daily basis. E valuations will come in the form of validating many of the assumptions we made above by putting your newly defined metric to work. For example: Honing Heuristics : We may find that the definition around “engaged user” is overly permissive and that 90% of our users are regularly considered “engaged,” which doesn’t leave much room for insight or improvement. We dig deeper to find that of the 90%, a majority became engaged through the “view at least 20 feed items” criteria, so we adjust that threshold up to 50 to create a higher bar for an engaged user. Disaggregating Actions : We may find that people who take actions against negative posts (hiding, unfollowing, reporting, or turning off notifications) actually correlates inversely to engagement. From this, we can decide to pull these actions out of our “interacting” bucket (bucket 3) and develop a separate metric to monitor negative Newsfeed behavior. Shifting Goals : We may find that we’ve done such a great job on engaging users with the Newsfeed that engagement is no longer the primary goal. Instead, we may decide to shift the goal to “monetization,” where we develop ad-related features into the Newsfeed. While engagement may not be the primary goal anymore, we want to continue monitoring the engagement metric to ensure the new monetization features do not have an adverse impact on engagement. A Case for Defining Your Metrics Before You Need Them In a “move fast and break things” world, it is tempting to concern yourself with metrics only after the product has launched. However, having metrics defined before you start development can translate to huge benefits because: Metrics help you maintain  focus Metrics set a  common goal  for team to rally around Metrics hold you (the PM)  accountable  to your users and business Metrics enable more  objective decision-making  during the critical launch period, including triage and prioritization Flying blind at any stage of your product’s lifecycle will substantially decrease your ability to learn. After all, you can’t improve what you don’t measure. Having the right data up front may be difference between success and failure for a  startup ! I hope this has been a useful breakdown on how to develop metrics.

"What Jobs-To-Be-Done research can teach you about your users, your product and your company",https://medium.com/@Productized/what-jobs-to-be-done-research-can-teach-you-about-your-users-your-product-and-your-company-b5240089c95b,"What Jobs-To-Be-Done research can teach you about your users, your product and your company Become a member Sign in Get started What Jobs-To-Be-Done research can teach you about your users, your product and your company Productized Follow Jan 22, 2018     ·       10    min read Whats is a JTBD theory? By  Rene Bastijans , product leader and facilitator of   Masterclass on Jobs to be Done This post is a case study for what you can learn about your users, your product and your company by applying  Jobs-To-Be-Done , a theory of motivation that seeks to understand why consumers buy and use products. A new way to understand what customers want and why they want it, JTBD can help you become better at building, marketing and selling products and services that people will buy. What’s Jobs-To-Be-Done theory? If you are unfamiliar with the theory of Jobs-To-Be-Done (JTBD),  Alan Klement ’s “ When Coffee and Kale Compete ” (available for free as pdf) is an excellent primer. Besides the theory, “JTBD” also describes what you are investigating when you are doing JTBD research. Here is a description from Alan’s book of what a JTBD is: “A Job to be Done is the process a consumer goes through whenever she aims to transform her existing life-situation into a preferred one, but cannot because there are constraints that stop her.” At the backend of 2016, I interviewed twenty existing and prospective users of our product applying the theory of Jobs-To-Be-Done. I set out to learn about our users’ struggles (their JTBD) by deconstructing their actual behaviours at work (what they really do vs. what they say they do). Equipped with this knowledge, I thought, our team would be able to become better at having conversations with our users and become better at making decisions about our product development and marketing. The following outlines what my JTBD-based interviews taught me about our users, our product and our company. I am sharing my learnings here in the hope that they will inspire you to explore the JTBD theory for your products and services. 1. We are in the business of helping our customers become better surfboard manufacturers The biggest learning has been that we are not simply providing a cloud-based “one-stop management tool for the Surfboard Manufacturing Industry” as we currently say on our website,  we are in the business of helping our customers become better surfboard manufacturers . This is the high-level job that the business owners, the people who are paying us, are using our product for to get done. Skatepark in Estoril (Lisbon) by  amarquet This is game changing in my opinion. We must understand that we are more than a technology company that builds an IT solution for people producing and selling surfboards. We are a company that is responsible for humans who are struggling and who are looking at us to help them become better. This is going to be a cultural change that will take time, especially for team members who are used to thinking that more features are the answer to our users’ problems and requests. As a team, we must learn to think every day how we can empower our users to solve their struggles through our product and thus make their lives better. 2. Becoming better surfboard manufacturers is an ongoing journey My interview data suggests that, just like learning to become a better surfer, becoming a better surfboard manufacturer is an ongoing journey. At a high level, this journey can be described in 3 stages. Leaning on surfing language, the 3 stages are: 1st stage:  “Paddling”  (Turning professional) 2nd stage:  “Pop-up”  (Surviving) 3rd stage:  “Riding the wave”  (Scaling) The above graphic is simplified. The journey to become better is not as linear as it looks. Each stage comes with its own challenges and jobs, and it can take a surfboard manufacturer many years, even decades, to progress from one stage to the next. The initial stage,  “Paddling” , is about transitioning from a beloved hobby (shaping and surfing) to a full-time profession. There are plenty of jobs that the “surfer-shaper” needs to get done to make this happen, e.g. acquiring more customers ordering boards, and there are many hires to resolve these jobs, e.g Instagram, Facebook or speaking to surfers on the beach. This is when our product first becomes attractive to surfer-shapers because they believe that with a product that helps them “get organised”, they will be able to enjoy more shaping and surfing whilst also getting the “office management job” done. Another benefit of JTBD-based research is it uncovers the “forces” that are at play when users are looking to make progress. In the 2nd stage, the  “Pop-up” , the “one-man show” has grown into a surfboard factory with a small number of in-house staff and contractors who do discrete production work steps assigned to them. As the business grows, new problems arise. In particular, keeping up with the increasing demand for boards and their timely delivery to customers becomes a problem. This is when they need solid surfboard production management. They hire various solutions for resolving this job from Excel spreadsheets to capture and track board orders to employing a dedicated Production Manager. Interestingly, the surfer-shaper who started the business, has now hired their wife to run the “business side of things” so that they themselves can continue to shape, surf and promote their brand. Surfboard manufacturers in the 3rd stage,  “Riding the wave” , are keen on scaling their businesses and sell surfboards in large quantities in the hope of becoming the world’s number 1 brand for surfing. Larger factories are strategically placed in several locations around the globe to satisfy demand. A dedicated General Manager and Sales team are in place managing large retail and distributor accounts. The factories enjoy a steady stream of board orders from their website and retail and distribution partners. Level up your skills as Product Manager: Join  Rene Bastijans  &  Andrej Balaz  for a full day of lectures, live customer interviews and hands-on practice that will help you understand the progress customers are wanting to make by bringing products into their lives.  Get 10% off the Masterclass on Jobs to be Done  in Lisbon on 1 February 2018 (apply a JTBD2018 code at checkout). At this Scaling stage, surfboard manufacturers are facing a new set of problems: they struggle with reporting on sales, forecasting for the next financial cycle, inventory management and selling wholesale to distributors and retailers without direct intervention from the Sales team. Revenue management and enabling distributors and retailers to place large orders for surfboards and accessories directly from the available stock are all good potential hires for this new JTBD,  “riding the wave” . 3. We need to appreciate where our product’s jobs stop Over the last 5 years, our product has grown into a behemoth of an application that could easily stand up to enterprise-level ERPs. Knowing that our users are going through at least 3 stages with changing jobs is telling us that a complex, one-size-fits-all solution that wants to be a production management, accounting, CRM, POS and e-commerce solution will only serve a small set of users. We need to learn not to attempt to solve the entire working day of your user through our product and appreciate where our product’s jobs stop. Why would we want to compete in areas that we have little expertise in and that have well-defined market leaders already anyway? 4. New opportunities are right in front of us I found out through my research which features do and do not help our users get their jobs done, i.e. help me turn professional or help me become the world’s number 1 brand for surfing. We can use this insight to make decisions about which features to improve or kill. Knowing our users’ jobs can also help us explore new product opportunities that will enable our users to make the desired progress as they move through the stages. Table created in Excel showing how a Production Manager struggles with scheduling new and existing surfboard orders. This could be a new opportunity for us. Furthermore, since we know our users’ jobs change throughout the stages, we should consider breaking the product down into separate sub-products, like  Intercom  did, that address a specific job for a stage and work together as a system. These sub-products could be priced separately and bundled up. Essentially, we could tap into new revenue. Another benefit of JTBD-based research is it uncovers the “forces” that are at play when users are looking to make progress.  These forces are the problems with and the attractions of our product, our users’ anxieties and their existing habits.  For example, for prospective users in Australia and the US, our biggest markets, it is a real concern that we are not in the same timezone. They need to be assured that a small team in Portugal that is 11 hours behind and 8 hours ahead respectively, is available to quickly resolve product issues that can potentially stop the board production. To reduce this anxiety, we have to adapt our support team’s availability. Jobs-To-Be-Done forces diagram by Margaret Wilkins Understanding the forces will not only help our team have more productive conversations with our existing and prospective users, it will also allow us to create marketing copy for our website and promotional materials that speaks directly to what our users value (making progress) and not only to what we value (our product’s features). 5. Our competitors are not our competition “  Competition is defined in the minds of customers, and they use progress as their criteria. ” —  Alan Klement ,  “When Coffee and Kale Compete” When speaking with our users, I learnt a lot about the solutions they stopped hiring once they started using our product and the solutions they would fall back on when they struggled with our product. These are predominantly Excel and Google Sheets to keep track of the board orders and payments as well as pen and paper to log work (typically factory workers get paid “piece rates”, i.e. by work step completed). Knowing our real competition, especially compensatory behaviour and existing habits, also helps us understand where our product falls short and where we need to improve. For example, scanning QR codes printed on the production order form, i.e. the A4 paper that details the surfboard’s specification, is a smart technology solution, but if pen and paper do a better job for workers to record their completed work step so that they get paid, then they won’t fire pen and paper. What’s next: The interviews uncovered plenty of issues that our users have with our product because they simply cannot get some of their jobs done due to technical bugs and usability and workflow issues that stem from thinking with an IT mindset. However, I also learnt that our product is helping them getting some of their jobs done pretty well today. In fact, in some instances, our product has become business critical and is the de-facto solution used to run the business. Without our product, these businesses would fail. This knowledge gives us confidence in our product and boosts overall morale, especially at a time when all we seem to be doing is fire-fighting. My research is just the beginning of our JTBD journey, and there is still plenty to explore. For now though, we have gained invaluable insights into our users’ lives, their struggles and motivations that can lead us in many ways. We must now incorporate this new knowledge into how we think and work if we want to deliver solutions that really help our users achieve their desired progress. Surf’s up!

Is Your Startup Fundable?,http://FI.co/posts/13491,"Have you ever wondered what qualities investors look for in a startup to consider it fundable? Benjamin Chong, a partner at Right Click Capital and a Co-Director of the Sydney Founder Institute, has created a three question test to help determine your answer in the article “Three ways to test if your startup is fundable,” on BRW.

Many entrepreneurs feel their problems will be solved with funding, but being fundable is very different from being in need of funding. Being fundable is all about your startup’s potential to attract financing so you can grow your business. All startup need some kind of funding to survive but not all are considered fundable.

Is your startup fundable? Read on to see what Benjamin Chong has say on the matter.

1. Are you solving a real problem?

When launching a startup, keep in mind that your company has to offer a real value to the world, or at least a part of it, before you seek funding. Here are some questions for you to consider:

What is the problem your startup is trying to solve?

Is it a real problem or a perceived one?

Have potential customers confirmed you’re solving a real problem?

What’s the market size of the problem?

Last week, I was presented with an idea for a personal electronic device that could help when paying for items at the cash register. While it was an interesting idea, I couldn’t see a real problem that the device was solving.”

2. Do you have a killer team?

Great minds think alike, so building your startup team is extremely important. Investors look for teams of individuals with a combination of technical background, business skills, and industry experience that are driven to succeed.

A great way to gain experience is by joining a startup and contributing to the success of a fledgling business. I’ve previously employed-future entrepreneurs, who’ve added immense value to our businesses. At the same time, they’ve gained an understanding of the frenetic pace of an early-stage business and developed skills from financial modelling to phone sales to graphic design.”

3. Are you gaining traction?

A startup with little to no traction will not pique the interest of investors. Make sure you are establishing a solid customer base and gaining traction over time. This will help investors determine if your startup is viable. Below are several questions that must be addressed before pushing your startup to the next level:

Do you have users or customers?

Is the rate of user growth increasing?

Have you been able to charge customers for your product or service?"
10 Resources to Help You Grow a Lean Startup,https://blog.producthunt.com/10-resources-to-help-you-grow-a-lean-startup-aad02b2354c,"10 Resources to Help You Grow a Lean Startup - Product Hunt Sign in Get started Top Products LIVE Books Company Archive 💌 Newsletter 10 Resources to Help You Grow a Lean Startup Product Hunt Follow May 27, 2016     ·       7    min read If you recently launched a startup—or you’re thinking about it—you’ll inevitably hit the “I have no idea what I’m doing” stage (if not once, then multiple times). It seems that there are countless problems to solve that you don’t necessarily have the tools or resources to answer, right? How do I gain early startup traction? How do I find a co-founder or build an early team? How do I come up with the cash to build an early team!? How do I know that my idea is even something people want?...And who in the world are those people, exactly? If you’ve found yourself asking some of these questions, there’s no better way to find the answers than by leaning on the knowledge of those who have already successfully navigated their way through the same entrepreneurial journey . Below, you’ll find ten great books, courses, and other resources to help you build your startup effectively in those early, lean stages. We can’t wait to see what comes out of the learning for you. :-) Startup Launch List Things you must read before launching a startup. There is such an overwhelming amount of content on the internet offering up advice on how to launch a startup. How do you weed through all of the noise? Thanks to  Startup Launch List , now you don’t have to. Select from a list of pain points—like coming up with an idea, building a team, raising money, and making money–and then get a beautifully curated list of the  must-read  articles on each topic. You’ll find great advice from some of tech’s top thought leaders, including: Paul Graham, Mark Suster, Brad Feld, Derek Sivers, Seth Godin, Chris Dixon and more. Traction Course Free course with 7 marketing super-hacks. Justin Mares  and  Gabriel Weinberg  co-wrote a book in 2015 called  Traction . It has quickly become one of the most important startup books because it details out exactly how to think about growing your startup, which is the (potentially) billion dollar question all founders want an answer to. Justin and Gabriel created  Traction Course   to showcase super-tactics in seven different marketing channels, including: email marketing, content marketing, publicity, and display and social ads. This is not to be missed. Good Email Copy Email copy from great companies. Even if it seems like such an overdone marketing channel, email remains one of the most effective ways to build and engage your customer base. And, writing email copy remains one of the most tedious marketing tasks ever. If you don’t want to reinvent the wheel completely, check out  Good Email Copy . Created by the  Front app  team, this is a collection of emails from great companies like Slack, Trello, Pinterest, Basecamp, Everlane, Eventbrite, Shopify, and more. You can sort by tag (e.g. welcome, thank you, new features, billing issue, invitation, upgrade, etc.), which makes it super easy to find sample copy related to the kind of email you’re looking to write. Petit Hacks Acquisition, retention, & revenue hacks used by companies. Petit Hacks  is a truly useful resource. Head to the site, and you’ll find countless examples of hacks various websites use to drive acquisition, revenue, referrals, retention, and activation. Each hack includes a screenshot and a short explanatory blurb. This is a fun site to browse if you’re looking for new mini traction strategies to try as you grow your startup. Brick by Brick A free guide to building awesome communities. Building products comes with its own unique challenges. Building   communities around a product? That’s another thing entirely.  Brick by Brick  is a comprehensive, free guide created by  Sacha Greif  that takes you through the various elements of community building. You’ll learn more about: engagement, promotion, moderation, voice, value, and audience segmentation. This is a useful resource that includes tidbits of wisdom from incredible community builders, like: Pieter Levels, Justin Kan, Josh Owens, and more. Make This Year Grow your core business by launching side projects. When you subscribe to  Make This Year , you’ll get a step-by-step lesson every month from an “experienced side project maker,” who will teach you how to grow your business in the most efficient way possible by building tools that create value for your customers. This is as lean as it gets: build one side project at a time, and see what sticks with your audience. And, with only one lesson a month, you won’t feel overwhelmed by the content. Traffic 1M Free lessons from the pros who’ve built massive websites. In the words of  Traffic 1M  creator  Noah Kagan , “If you build it they will come. Just kidding.” It is  hard  to drive an audience to your site—especially in the very beginning. If you’ve ever asked yourself the question, “How do I drive a ton of traffic to my site quickly and cheaply?,” then this is for you. Noah, who has worked on Facebook, Mint, AppSumo, and SumoMe, along with 15 other traffic generation experts, share some of their best traffic generation tactics. You’ll learn how to incentivize social sharing, own your SEO, test your content, create smart social ads. This is, without a doubt, some of the best advice in the online traffic game. Growth Hacker Course A short course on the future of PR, marketing, and advertising. The  Growth Hacker Course   was created by  Ryan Holiday  based on his popular book  Growth Hacker Marketing . He walks you through a four-step framework that begins with helping you find product-market fit, and ends with retention and optimization hacking. There’s only so much you can learn about startup growth tactics from a book; at some point, the only thing left to do is start experimenting in real life. This course will guide you through that process with various exercises you can try as you learn about each step in the framework. Since taking action is the whole point (and also the hardest part) of learning, we’re pumped about the design of this course. Business Model Kit Explore revenue models to make money with your idea. This kit makes business modeling fun again. If you aren’t sure exactly what your startup’s business model is yet, The  Business Model Kit  is a useful tool that will help you whiteboard what your company might look like in 5, 10, or 20 years. There are 16 different blocks to help you visualize your model (e.g. consumers, suppliers, government, product, service, experience, data money, exposure, etc.). When you’re thinking about the bigger picture—like multiple revenue streams, partnerships, and complex supplier transactions—this will help you get your creative (and organizational) juices going. Lean Series Books The entire Lean Series, published by O’Reilly, is packed with incredible insight and strategies for growing your startup—especially in the early stages when there’s often no other option but to run “lean.” We highly recommend starting with Ash Maurya’s  Running Lean , which is all about finding the right product-market fit. Effectively, it’s a step-by-step blueprint for taking your ideas, turning them into experiments, and taking action quickly. Once you’ve devoured that book, pick up some of the others based on your startup’s most pressing needs. There are so many other incredible books, podcasts, and software tools designed to help you grow your company as effectively as possible—particularly when you’re first starting out. If you want even more resources to help you think through the best way to build your business, you can find them on Product Hunt, starting with  this collection of Lean Startup Tools : Product Hunt The place to discover your next favorite thing.

 From pipes  to platforms: Leveraging the network effect

 Annie Turner looks at network effects, which when a company gets them right, make platforms super successful – and faster than anything the business world has ever seen. How can network operators benefit from network effects and create new value? 
 Look at the table below and the first thing that shocks is how fast these platform-based companies grew, especially when compared to their venerable ‘counterparts’. No wonder so many long-established businesses are reeling. 
 
 Professor Geoffrey G. Parker, who is widely recognized as a leading thinker on platform-based businesses and whose credentials span engineering and business, points out that the world’s biggest five companies by market capitalization are all platform companies. Apple, Alphabet (Google’s parent), Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook have displaced the oil companies and banks that held the top slots for decades. 
 How do successful platforms grow so fast? Through network effects, which every business needs to understand and foster. This is how it works: the more people are on your network the more valuable the business and the more effective you are. 
 What’s going on? 
 In the pipeline model, there is little in the way of network effects. Instead there is a supply chain, from raw materials to distribution. At every stage someone is paid for their contribution, and the value accrues as the process progresses. The sale price has to be bigger than the overall cost for everyone to make their margins, but there is little in the way of the network effect. 
 The platform model collapses that process, creating what Parker calls a triangular platform (see graphic), whereby the platform provides a marketplace for interchanges between producers and consumers. It removes pain points for both and enables all kinds of companies to create new services and value – and especially small ones that could never afford the resources and upfront capital costs on their own. 
 
 YouTube and Apple are both great examples of this. YouTube offers tools to help producers upload videos easily and quickly. On the consumption side, there is search, matching, filtering, playing and sharing. The platform deals with all the different standards and devices, to create markets that didn’t previously exist and run various business models on one platform. 
 In January 2017, Apple stated that in the previous year, app developers collectively earned over $20 billion. On average, the company gets about 30 percent of that as revenue share, according to  Business Insider . 
 “The platform provides a marketplace for interchanges between producers and consumers. It removes pain points for both and enables all kinds of companies to create new services and value.” 
 Parker says, “Platforms drop transaction costs like a rock. Whereas you used to need an army of lawyers to get anything done, now it’s plug and play.” 
 Who can play? 
 Can any product or service become the basis of a platform business? Here’s the Parker test: “If a firm can either use information or community to add value to what it sells, then there is the potential to create a platform. This means there is a huge amount of opportunity for a lot of companies.” 
 Simon Torrance, Advisor, BearingPoint, adds, “It’s [already] a $4 trillion market. Today, no telco operates like this, yet we have all the assets and capabilities to do so.” 
 8 things to consider 
 Telcos inherently understand the network effect – the more people are on your network or you can connect to someone else via partners, the more valuable your business and the more effective you are. We created a global network for telegraphy then phone calls more than a century ago, we can replicate this for digital services. Here’s how. 
 
 Forget Facebook:  Parker comments, “The B2C market is largely done, we need to look towards the internet of things, smart cities and medical technologies – the B2B side. That is an $80 trillion global economy that is rapidly digitizing and the B2C stuff is an itty-bitty side show by comparison. There is huge opportunity to be there first.” 
 Don’t customize, configure:  Be modular is the approach TM Forum enshrines in all its assets and activities. The mantra is build open, standardized, reconfigurable systems and avoid customization. Many telcos are moving towards this ideal to reduce costs, risk and time to market, and increase their business agility while leveraging assets.  George Glass, Chief Systems Architect, BT, explains  what his company has achieved on this front, to great effect. 
 Gain global reach:  Telcos can exploit that modularity to scale by partnering with other telcos to gain geographical reach if everyone uses open APIs. As Parker says, “Put the complexity behind the scenes and have something that’s easy to attach to and pass data between”. 
 Look outside:  Shift attention from inside to outside the company because that’s where your users and partners are who create transactions, which is how you monetize your network. To have an external focus you must have a community strategy. 
 Cherish your community:  Design architecture to regulate participation – troublemakers are a fact of life, but control points in the analytics can detect them and prevent them driving others away. Put another way, promote positive interactions among partners in a multi-sided market. 
 Design your business model carefully, around all your customers:  Don’t introduce too many adverts, for instance. That killed MySpace stone dead because it spoiled the user experience. And don’t introduce too many onerous steps to access the platform and services, it will repel users. 
 Resource orchestration, not control:  In the platform world, not everything is counted nor appears on the balance sheet. Resources need orchestration as the aim is to provide a market for excess capacity that previously could not be traded. The question is, “How can we lower transaction costs so that the capacity we’ve got sitting on our balance sheet can find a market?…It’s not about locking everything down, it’s about opening it up, which is a completely different mindset.” 
 And finally:  Parker says, “Move from focusing just on serving that one end customer…and bargaining against a supply chain, [instead] look at the customer as an inside user and treat them as such. Thinking in terms of a dollar in the supply side’s pocket is one less in yours doesn’t work – it becomes meaningless. Rather invest in their ability to produce because that drives transactions, which is how you monetize your network. 
 
 Geoffrey G. Parker is Professor, Thayer School Engineering, Dartmouth College and Director, Master of Engineering Management Program, and Research Fellow, MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy. He is the co-author of  Platform Revolution  with Marshall W. Van Alstyne and Sangeet Paul Choudary. He has spoken at two TM Forum Digital Leadership/BearingPoint Summits.

"Startup advice, briefly",http://blog.samaltman.com/startup-advice-briefly,"This is a very short summary with lots left out—here is the long version: http://startupclass.samaltman.com







You should start with an idea, not a company. When it’s just an idea or project, the stakes are lower and you’re more willing to entertain outlandish-sounding but potentially huge ideas. The best way to start a company is to build interesting projects.

On the other hand, when you have a “company” that you feel pressure to commit to an idea too quickly. If it’s just a project, you can spend more time finding something great to work on, which is important—if the startup really works, you’ll probably be working on it for a very long time.

Have at least one technical founder on the team (i.e. someone who can build whatever the company is going to build).

In general, prefer a fast-growing market to a large but slow-growing one, especially if you have conviction the fast-growing market is going to be important but others dismiss it as unimportant.

The best startup ideas are the ones that seem like bad ideas but are good ideas.

Make something people want. You can screw up most other things if you get this right; if you don’t, nothing else will save you.

Once you’ve shifted from “interesting project” to “company” mode, be decisive and act quickly. Instead of thinking about making a decision over the course of week, think about making it in an hour, and getting it done in the next hour.

Become formidable. Also become tough—the road ahead is going to be painful and make you doubt yourself many, many times.

Figure out a way to get your product in front of users. Start manually (read this: http://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html)

Listen to what your users tell you, improve your product, and then listen again. Keep doing this until you’ve made something some users love (one of the many brilliant Paul Buchheit observations is that it’s better to build something a small number of users love than something a lot of users like). Don’t deceive yourself about whether or not your users actually love your product.

Keep your burn rate very low until you’re sure you’ve built something people love. The easiest way to do this is hire slowly.

Have a strategy. Most people don’t. Occasionally take a little bit of time to think about how you’re executing against your strategy. Specifically, remember that someday you need to have a monopoly (in the Peter Thiel sense).

Read this before you raise money: http://paulgraham.com/fr.html.

Learn to ask for what you want.

Ignore what the press says about you, especially if it’s complimentary.

Generate revenue early in the life of your company.

Hire the best people you can. However much time you’re spending on this, it’s probably not enough. Give a lot of equity to your employees, and have very high expectations. Smart, effective people are critical to success. Read this: http://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-hire.

Fire people quickly when you make hiring mistakes.

Don’t work with people you don’t have a good feeling about—this goes for employees (and cofounders), partners, investors, etc.

Figure out a way to get users at scale (i.e. bite the bullet and learn how sales and marketing work). Incidentally, while it is currently in fashion, spending more than the lifetime value of your users to acquire them is not an acceptable strategy.

Obsess about your growth rate, and never stop. The company will build what the CEO measures. If you ever catch yourself saying “we’re not really focused on growth right now”, think very carefully about the possibility you’re focused on the wrong thing. Also, don’t let yourself be deceived by vanity metrics.

Eventually, the company needs to evolve to become a mission that everyone, but especially the founders, are exceptionally dedicated to. The “missionaries vs. mercenaries” soundbite is overused but true.

Don’t waste your time on stuff that doesn’t matter (i.e. things other than building your product, talking to your users, growing, etc.). In general, avoid the kind of stuff that might be in a movie about running a startup—meeting with lawyers and accountants, going to lots of conferences, grabbing coffee with people, sitting in lots of meetings, etc. Become a Delaware C Corp (use Clerky or any well-known Silicon Valley law firm) and then get back to work on your product.

Focus intensely on the things that do matter. Every day, figure out what the 2 or 3 most important things for you to do are. Do those and ignore other distractions. Be a relentless execution machine.

Do what it takes and don’t make up excuses.

Learn to manage people. Make sure your employees are happy. Don’t ignore this.

In addition to building a great product, if you want to be really successful, you also have to build a great company. So think a lot about your culture.

Don’t underestimate the importance of personal connections.

Ignore acquisition interest until you are sure you want to sell. Don’t “check the market”. There is an alternate universe somewhere full of companies that would have been great if they could have just avoided this one mistake. Unfortunately, in this universe, they’re all dead.

Work really hard. Everyone wants a secret to success other than this; if it exists, I haven’t found it yet.

Keep doing this for 10 years."

 Email Culture Definition: Improving Your Organization’s Culture to Grow and Innovate. In 2014, Merriam Webster named “Culture” the word of the year. Merriam-Webster chose  culture   by analyzing their most popular words, and which experienced the biggest spike in look-ups during the year. “Culture is a word that we seem to be relying on more and more. It allows us to identify and isolate an idea, issue, or group with seriousness,” Peter Sokolowski, editor-at-large for Merriam-Webster.”  1 Why defining organizational culture is important, now more than ever. Culture definition is the starting point for any meaningful improvement in your corporate culture. Organizational culture is becoming an essential conversation for three reasons: The rapid pace of change demands  that organizations cultivate change as a capability, not an event. Culture is the fuel source of that capability. Emerging values among younger generations are creating a movement  to make the meaning and experience of work as important as results and effort. This is impacting ALL people, not just Millennials. The work contract is no longer simply “time in exchange for a paycheck.” Many smart, talented people are choosing to work for lower pay or extend their job search, rather than work for a company with no heart. A conscious effort to build a great workplace culture grounded in modern habits pays off in attracting and retaining better talent, and ensures more dedication while they work for you. The fundamental metaphor of business  indicates how we view and treat people. It is not longer PC to view people as machines that can be switched on/off or measured precisely (the Industrial Age metaphor for people). Or, “human capital” – FTE numbers on a spreadsheet that produces ROI, or a cost-cutting opportunity. These metaphors and measures have value in a for-profit business. But they do nothing to tap  the inherent people power  and human potential in your business. The question we should be asking is: How should the conversation about corporate culture – and  culture definition in your organization  – be at the forefront of strategic conversations in board rooms, lunchrooms, and even home offices? Human beings need connection, purpose/meaning, freedom, and growth, to thrive. Yet, the human qualities of free-thinking, possibility-seeking, empathy, collaboration are largely stifled and under-valued in corporate environments. Ironically, efficiency and productivity outcomes are MORE possible when you build the proper structure to cultivate and harness these very qualities. Whatever you sell or deliver, it’s a good bet your marketing department is working hard to inspire and sell to your customers by tapping  their  innate desire for connection, purpose, meaning, freedom. And yet, most of your employees would say those qualities are not welcomed or rewarded effectively  inside  their company. Most of my work these days is helping leaders understand why (and how) the authentic and messy and unpredictable people stuff, is not a  barrier  to ROI, but a cornerstone of high performance. Learning how to befriend and harness the energy tapped through aligning people’s communication, work habits, and unique organization’s mission with your customer needs. This IS corporate culture. And, it is THE revolution in business that is key to ongoing and sustainable innovation, growth, and performance. Because right now, employees at every level of most organizations are confused and disheartened by the  lack  of alignment. Tired of spending half of their life in a workplace environment that is confusing and stressful, just to feed their family. Most leaders at the top, have given little or no thought to what it’s really like to be a Director or Manager in your organization: To receive two emails in the same  hour  – one about a planned company layoff  and  one saying “we’re hiring in your department.” (Neither of which the person knew about, who is now being asked to explain it to people who got the same email in her Department.) To motivate teams in meaningful ways when leaders are preaching excitedly about maximizing EBITDA and stock price – an abstraction that doesn’t benefit them, their family or community directly. (Nor do they have a clue what it measures or how their effort impact it.) Trying to rally the troops below them, by translating a high level “says-nothing” vision into clear priorities for their people – while VP’s and above do not act or speak with any alignment on those priorities, which seem to change monthly. These are commonly cited examples from interviews I have done as part of my  cultural assessment  work – based on real-world conversations with people in companies just like yours. This confusion is the NORM in most companies today.  The term “corporate culture” – and the rising attention on the term – is about companies trying to make sense of what has gone wrong in our “state of work.” In 15 years of helping leaders and companies define and evolve their organizational culture, I can say with confidence, NOW is the time to explore a meaningful definition of culture in your organization, as a basis to reinvent the way work is done and what it means. Not as this year’s initiative, but as a way to align with the growing movement that is re-shaping the fundamental contract of worker and employer. Get on the wave, or be crushed by it. Your choice. What is Organizational Culture … ? The definition of culture according to Merriam-Webster: : the beliefs, customs, arts, etc., of a particular society, group, place, or time : a particular society that has its own beliefs, ways of life, art, etc. : a way of thinking, behaving, or working that exists in a place or organization (such as a business) Is Culture Definition the Answer or the Question? In business, the word Culture has become synonymous with “This is a good or bad place to work” – especially in the minds of millennials. References to corporate culture have begun to make their way into TV and movie scripts, with the subtle nuance “If you don’t have a corporate culture I like, I’m outta here. “ A New Yorker article said this, about the Culture Word of the Year: “… if words are tools for thinking, then [in 2014] “culture” has been used to think about the parts of our society that function poorly. That may even be a sign, in a way, of an improvement in our culture. If our increasingly analytical, sociological way of thinking about “culture” is helping us to improve the culture, that’s a positive development. Confusion over its evolving meaning is a good reason to look up “culture” in the dictionary, but so is an interest in understanding the world and making it better.”  3 This is the crux of the matter: The increasing desire for “Culture Definition” in business, signals a quest for meaning and making things better, more than a particular answer to “What is culture.” People (of all generations, not just Millennials) are demanding an opportunity to evolve, expand, and improve the quality of their life and work. (whether they say it out loud or not, the desire grows stronger every year.) The word “culture” is the collective expression of this quest. Work largely determines the quality of our life. Your people are increasingly reluctant to sacrifice one for the other. This is not simply a demand “Leaders please fix this.” It is a collective and conscious cry: “How can we work together to shift and evolve our workplaces, from this fragile state of confusion, imbalance, constant hyper-drive? What is culture to a business? When you define culture, you send a message “Here, we care about people” and “We get it.” In reality, culture definition is only the beginning. Fostering a corporate culture that drives growth, high performance, and collaborative teamwork requires more walk than talk. Clear intention and patience. The will power to develop and foster the alignment needed through: A vision that matters (more than “bigger bonuses for executives”) and is communicated frequently. Daily work that is not over-shadowed by constant bureaucratic and political minutae. Real opportunities for employees to grow in their career (even if it’s not climbing the ladder). Promoting and empowering people who live the values AND work hard. (Beware promoting that top performer who leaves a trail of dead bodies. You do BIG damage to your culture with this move.) Easier said than done, widespread adoption of new habits that build an open, collaborative corporate culture.  But, it pays off big in: Improving your ability to recruit talent. A stronger connection and loyalty to your organization. Greater willingness to accept ownership and responsibility. The subtle and important key is this: Do your employees believe in what you’re selling to your customers? BE the brand for your employees, that you want your customers to become loyal to… and watch the magic happen. Culture Definition Examples in Great Companies The best companies invest in their culture AS their brand.  2  It all begins with changing how they think about, talk with, and treat people. Here are a few examples: Google  – a company that is synonymous with culture, Google’s current Culture Definition challenge, is to maintain a unifying culture as they grow and spread out geographically – a quest that will require effort along with a willingness to allow sub-cultures to develop while maintaining the core spirit. REI  – Culture Definition at REI is “who we hire = who we are.” With a mission to equip both customers and employees for the outdoors, to have fun and promote stewardship of the environment – hiring and empowering employees who can immerse themselves in REI’s culture IS what makes it unique. REI says its employees give “life to their purpose” and they give full credit to employees for their success. Employees can submit a proposal in the popular “challenge grants” to get equipment for an outdoor adventure they find challenging. When employees of a company are aligned with its values and are fully immersed in what the organization sells (ie, customers and employees are similar), the culture propels itself forward almost on its own. Twitter  – Culture Definition at Twitter at its core is smart, dedicated people. Employees LOVE working at Twitter. Like many hi-tech companies, they offer culture perks like free meals, yoga, meetings on the roof. But more than anything, Tweeps (Twitter employees) will say “I love working with other smart people.” (The hiring theme again). Workers rave about being part of a company that is doing something that matters in the world, and there is a sense that no one leaves until the work gets done. Adobe  – Adobe’s Culture Definition might be summed up as Empowerment. Adobe products are synonymous with creativity, and only through the avoidance of micromanaging are the people who create those products truly free to create. They value how Adobe’s corporate culture is consistently shaping itself to “trust employees to do their best.”  Adobe does not use performance ratings to establish employee capabilities, feeling it inhibits creativity and harms how teams work. Managers take on the role of a coach, letting employees set goals and determine how they should be assessed. What is culture to a CEO, President or executive team? Why are executives increasingly concerned with corporate culture? Simple: Culture issues are impacting their bottom line. This is more than a culture definition problem. The forces of technology and globalization demand increasingly complex strategies, with more rigorous analysis and data, while you maintain the constant ability to adjust, adapt, and course-correct. This is a people-centered task: We can build a computer that analyzes the best choice in a high-risk decision. But robots will never create a movement that inspires people to camp overnight to buy the latest Apple device. In the 2015 movie Martian (in which Matt Damon plays an astronaut stranded on Mars) the character Mark Watney launches himself (Iron Man style) into space in hopes to intercept with the Captain of his mother ship (or, be cast into space forever.)  The ship is a mere 63 kilometers away, yet traveling at HIGH speed. He has no steering mechanism, only the complex mathematic calculations of the team on-board the ship and the fierce intention of his Captain and himself to  make it happen . Your people are like Mark Watney in your business – often feeling untethered from your company, leaders’ vision and strategies, but desiring connection. The paradox of succeeding at rapid-change-upon-change, while maintaining a stabilizing mission and connection, can only be solved by fully optimizing BOTH scientific, dedicated effort  and  heart. We see this in practical ways in business: Strategic planning and change management models are becoming more  dynamic and responsive to the market, as are tactics to create alignment with shifting priorities and problem solving. It’s tough enough to align 10 people to constant shifts, let alone 10,000 or 100,000. Organizational culture in today’s global arena, is about combining the “smarts and heart” capability to adapt and re-align teams quickly, while maintaining the essence of harmony and connection with one another. Executives who understand this alchemy, increase the odds of success in rapid-change, high-risk conditions, when the conditions themselves are unknown and uncertain. In years of assessing corporate cultures, I have come to see culture change work as addressing this paradox. Building specific (and new) habits to accomplish two important goals: Align with the desire for meaning AND Provide a stabilizing force in the face of constant change. (This is why I do not believe in one cookie-cutter culture for a global organization – people need consistency and unifying tribal identity, while being encouraged to express their local culture and relationships in ways that honor their roots and make sense to them.) Sometimes I tell my clients: “A Communication Overhaul is the primary work needed in organizations today.” Employee communication are rarely aligned with these two goals. They need to be shorter, more frequent, thematic, personal, and face-to-face. Just as communicating to your customers had to evolve, so does communicating with your internal customers – ie, employees. Your Culture Revolution: What do you choose? The rewarding but sometimes messy, complicated  work of building a modern corporate culture is not possible inside the paradigm of a stressed-out, bottom-line-only world view. It takes leadership courage and focus. Neuroscience research has proven that our brain, flooded with adrenaline, does not “create” under stress. Stress triggers one thing: Take cover, or run. But most companies today run on adrenaline-fueled productivity as their default state. Changing this toxic and non-sustainable condition, means  choosing  the health and well-being of your people as a priority. Not only as the right thing to do (signalling a new, more human-centered metaphor for business), but as a strategy that directly impacts your ROI.  As the quality of soil determines the quality of your crop, the well-being of your people will increasingly affect your growth and profit. Which means not only  defining  the corporate culture you want and need to attract great employees and customers, but spending time, resources, and energy  building  it. The revolution surrounding corporate cultures, is real and practical. Companies are filled with people wanting it, and hoping their CEO will support a  redesign the human experience of work . The task ahead is making it the gold standard in every company. As with any revolution in a society, the society  chooses  to either reinvent itself, or the revolution reinvents you. Here’s hoping you choose to be out in front of your Culture Revolution. —— REFERENCE ARTICLES 1  Time.com – “Merriam Webster Names its Word of the Year.”  Dec 15, 2014 2  Entrepreneur – 10 Examples of Companies with Fantastic Cultures    http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/249174 3  New Yorker – “The Meaning of Culture”  – December 26, 2014 – http://www.newyorker.com/books/joshua-rothman/meaning-culture

Product Management Explained in 3 Words,http://spectechular.walkme.com/product-management-explained-in-3-words/,"Yes. Just, yes. One of the aspects of design that I must admit to loving, and I am really happy is finally catching on, is the aspect of modern simplicity. Open floor plans for houses, simple and sleek lines on sports cars, and products. The iPhone really started the trend, with a simple yet sleek phone. No need for flip phones with gimmicks. Personally I believe design should be simple and clean, and if you want to make it stand out you should add a subtle change.

Below is an infographic by Martin Eriksson that perfectly describes a product manager’s position. As a product manager I need to be business minded, understand the user experience and understand technology. A good product manager understands the aspects of all three circles and must understand how to merge them together. What’s important for you to understand is that product managers don’t need to be the best. There’s a reason that you’re not one whole circle.

Another interpretation of the infographic is that you bind them all together. You are the meeting point of all three aspects of your company; you are the intersection in the road. Force all three aspects to look at each other and understand that other aspects exist. Don’t let the circles drift apart but keep them together."

 Acquisitions, done well,  can be a powerful tool to accelerate revenue growth. And pushing for gains is vital in software and online services, where the rate of growth typically determines whether a company thrives, survives, or dies. While 20 percent revenue growth is enviable in most industries, companies in software and online services are expected to deliver numbers that are markedly higher. In fact, we’ve found that software and online-services companies with revenue that grows by more than 60 percent annually when they hit $100 million in sales are eight times more likely to eventually pass $1 billion in annual revenue than players with revenue that grows by less than 20 percent annually. 1   1. 
For more, see Eric Kutcher, Olivia Nottebohm, and Kara Sprague, “ Grow fast or die slow ,” April 2014; and Rishi Kant, Eric Kutcher, Mitra Mahdavian, and Kara Sprague, “ Grow fast or die slow: Pivoting beyond the core ,” April 2015.
   
 
However, acquisitions, done episodically, can also stifle growth. Our research shows that acquiring companies infrequently may actually disrupt organic growth and slow overall revenue gains. We examined the acquisition activity of 578 software and online-services companies that surpassed $100 million in annual revenue 2   2. 
The data set includes companies that first surpassed $100 million in revenue after 1995 and that provided multiple years of public data while earning revenue of $100 million to $1 billion.
    and identified three lessons: 
 
 
 Low-volume acquisition programs disrupt growth; high-volume programs accelerate growth.  The software and online-services companies whose revenue grew most rapidly had high-volume acquisition programs. 
 
 Successful acquisition programs complement organic growth.  Among software and online-services companies that reached $1 billion in annual revenue, acquisition efforts preserved or accelerated organic growth. These companies completed more deals, squeezed more growth out of each deal, and managed to preserve high organic growth while investing energy in finding and incorporating acquisitions. 
 
 Successful acquisitions align with growth strategy.  Companies that accelerate revenue growth through acquisitions don’t treat deals as an opportunistic event to capture cost synergies. They use several different deal archetypes—all linked to their fundamental growth strategy.

 Low-volume acquisition programs disrupt growth; high-volume programs accelerate growth 
 
Some software companies rocket past $1 billion in annual revenue on organic growth alone. Yet for those that seek to supplement everyday growth with acquisitions, it’s not enough to check the box with a deal here and there. Our research found that companies making less than one acquisition per year on average have worse revenue growth than those that did no deals. By contrast, companies undertaking one to two deals a year had double the revenue growth of those doing no deals, and companies acquiring two or more companies a year averaged significantly higher growth (Exhibit 1).

 Successful acquisition programs complement organic growth 
 
The acquisition programs of companies that achieved $1 billion in annual revenue delivered organic growth superior to that of companies falling short of the $1 billion mark. As Exhibit 2 shows, companies that reached $1 billion in revenue had nearly twice as much growth from acquisitions as companies that did not, but they saw 31 times the organic-growth contribution. Successful companies drove results in three areas: preserving or enhancing business momentum (or organic growth), executing more deals, and translating each deal into more revenue growth.

Let’s look at each element. First, and most important,  a company needs to preserve its business momentum . Software and online-services companies that used acquisitions and successfully moved from $100 million in annual revenue to $1 billion were able to maintain rapid organic-revenue growth (31 percent a year); companies that did not reach the $1 billion mark achieved just 1 percent organic-revenue growth each year. Acquisition activity can distract management and direct resources away from the existing business, or it can preserve and even enhance growth in the core business. Successful companies achieve the latter. 
 
Second, companies that reached $1 billion in annual revenue  undertook more deals each year  (1.5 deals on average) than those that did not (0.9 deals). We found that executing more deals delivered an additional seven percentage points of revenue growth annually. The bottom line is that executing a successful acquisition program is not as simple as buying more companies. It requires a systematic, disciplined approach to deal discovery and execution that is improved over time. Trying to jam more deals through a broken process will only compromise organic growth and the chance of success. 3   3. 
For more, see Werner Rehm, Robert Uhlaner, and Andy West, “ Taking a longer-term look at M&A value creation ,”  McKinsey Quarterly , January 2012.
   
 
Third, companies that get to $1 billion in annual revenue can  achieve more growth per deal —a compound annual growth rate of 13 percent, compared with 11 percent for companies that do not reach this threshold. Although a difference of two percentage points is small, the ability to capture more growth from deals adds up when combined with a greater deal volume. This means the acquisition programs of successful companies deliver annual revenue growth of 19 percent on average, almost twice the 10 percent of companies that are unable to reach the $1 billion level. 
 
So do the fastest-growing software and online-services companies use acquisitions? Yes. When we examined the fastest-growing 10 percent of companies, we found that they all used acquisitions—and that they all had high-volume acquisition programs, delivered the greatest average excess total return to shareholders, 4   4. 
Total return to shareholders (TRS) measures the return to shareholders in all forms (for example, dividends and price increases). It is the return if all dividends were reinvested in the stock. We define excess TRS as the annualized return above the average TRS of the sample. It is calculated by comparing TRS with a weighted index composed of the entire sample.
    and achieved annual revenue growth of more than 100 percent (Exhibit 3).

Our conclusion is that acquisition programs should be robust, and they must build on the core business. It’s the combination of organic and inorganic growth that allows companies to survive and delivers excess total return to shareholders. 
 Successful acquisitions align with growth strategy 
 
It is no surprise that most deals in software and online services appear to be aligned with growth rather than costs. Yet this does not mean that all deals are the same. We identified four common deal archetypes and rationales aligned with accelerating growth: 
 
 
 Audience expansion or consolidation.  Once a company has established a successful offering, growth can be supplemented by acquiring a target with an applicable audience or customer base. This can improve the scale of the offering, allow the company to reach new geographies, enhance the credibility of a product or service, and improve the value proposition for products that benefit from greater market share. One example of this is the combination of several audiences for travel websites (Expedia, Hotels.com, Hotwire, and TripAdvisor) under the umbrella of IAC. However, executing acquisitions poorly may drive away acquired customers and yield diminishing returns. In such transactions, it’s important to pay attention to both existing customers and new customer opportunities. 
 
 Gap fills.  A company may use acquisitions to fill gaps in its core product or service offering. For example, Salesforce.com’s acquisition of Jigsaw allowed it to automate the way it acquired and maintained business-contact data and to improve the value proposition of its core customer-relationship-management offering. A deep technical understanding is critical to ensure that the gap is successfully addressed by the target’s offering or intellectual property and that the target can be successfully integrated with the acquirer’s existing solutions. 
 
 Speed to adjacency.  Companies looking beyond their core offering for growth typically pursue opportunities in adjacent markets. In the fast-paced realm of software and online services, organic entry may be too slow. In such cases, companies often use acquisitions to speed their entry. Synopsys, for example, acquired Coverity to expand into the software-testing market. Adobe, Oracle, and SAP are serial adjacency acquirers. The risk of this type of acquisition is that the adjacent market or target company is not as attractive as expected, or that the company does not have what it takes to win in the new market after the acquisition. To address this, companies need to understand their core differentiators and where they have the familiarity to succeed. 5   5. 
    See Rishi Kant, Eric Kutcher, Mitra Mahdavian, and Kara Sprague, “ Grow fast or die slow: Pivoting beyond the core ,” April 2015.
       
 
 Acqui-hire.  These deals are focused on securing distinctive talent that can enhance the acquirer’s core offering, and the offerings of the target usually are discontinued. When Facebook bought FriendFeed, for instance, the deal brought on board several talented employees, including Bret Taylor, who went on to become Facebook’s chief technology officer. The central risks with this type of acquisition are not surprising: the inability to retain employees of the company that has been acquired, and the potential for the acquiring company to overestimate the individual capabilities of the acquired company. 6   6.

These archetypes illustrate the ways that acquisitions can accelerate revenue growth. Moreover, they show how opportunities could align with an acquirer’s growth strategy rather than emanating from a target’s current market price, a shared industry, or the opportunity to reduce overhead. 
 Putting it all together 
 
Software and online-services companies thinking of doing one acquisition per year are actually better served doing no deals. To drive the type of growth required to thrive in the software and online-services sector, acquisitions must be done regularly and treated as a capability that fuels both organic and inorganic growth. Companies that successfully accelerate from $100 million to $1 billion in annual revenue typically undertake more than two deals per year, use acquisitions to accelerate their core organic growth, and deliberately align the deal rationale with their most pressing growth challenges. In short, what matters is not whether you do acquisitions. What counts is how you do them.

 This article on the importance of sales and marketing lead generation is a guest contribution by Mathieu Picard, CEO of  Anyleads . 
   
 
 
 What is lead generation infrastructure? 
 
 Within the scope of direct marketing strategy, lead generation describes the process of stimulating and capturing interest in a product or service for the purpose of increasing sales. 
 For most companies, finding potential customers and successfully reaching them is a long and difficult process. Lead generation combines the marketing actions businesses can take to create and build interest in a product or service to generate new customers. 
 Technologically based marketing actions that rely on computer programs, database collection and the internet to find and contact potential customers are the foundation of lead generation infrastructure solutions. 
 However, lead generation can also mean direct contact through cold calling or events where sales representatives rouse interest and convert prospective customers into viable leads through face to face interactions. 
 Lead generation infrastructures are an example of SaaS (Software as a Service) which provides an API to automate the process of generating leads. The final result is a qualified and organized database of prospects (leads) that your business can use to target your message. 
 Automation can simplify the direct marketing actions of your business and allow you to focus your attention on less repetitive tasks. Using an email finder guarantees you a sustainable stream of prospects to contact every day and automated contact forms then allow you to identify which customers are the best to present your final sales pitch to. 
 As these technological processes change the marketing landscape, many marketing traditionalists may not have heard of these new approaches. Cutting-edge technology is making it possible to expand your customer base, multiply your growth and do so in a way that differentiates you from your competition. 
 What are the advantages? 
 There are many different strategic directions to go with digital and direct marketing options. Lead generation infrastructure which automates the tedious processes involved makes your outbound marketing significantly more efficient, at an affordable price. 
 When it comes to budget concerns email marketing is by far the cheapest direct marketing method. Although it has a low conversion rate it has the highest return on investment available. 
 There are many ways to increase the conversion rate and when you consider the expanded capabilities possible with lead generation SaaS it’s clear that this option gives you the most bang for your buck! Email marketing is an effective way to enhance traffic, visibility and sales which is why this approach boasts the highest ROI compared to all other (much more expensive) methods. 
 The use of a lead generation infrastructure is a good way to guarantee a reliable and continuous stream of new leads for your company! Make the best use of your valuable time by automating the most tedious and repetitive tasks! 
 How does it work? 
 The advanced search features available within the lead generation infrastructures allows you to compile mass lists of contacts that fit your unique requirements. The large lists are highly targeted so with each entry you increase your chances of contacting interested customers and converting them into viable leads. 
 “You can build massive, precisely targeted lists in only a few days” – Mathieu Picard 
 Lead generation infrastructure is also very useful for B2B businesses who wish to target their prospects through their professional email addresses. Most of the time the relevant information (emails, names, job titles and position etc) is gathered through data available on social media networks but by searching the name of the company or the domain of its website the software can also find employee emails to include in the database. 
 Trustworthy lead generation infrastructure: 
 Anyleads is a good example of a lead generation infrastructure that provides trustworthy services to customers all over the world. Anyleads uses back-end technology to mine data and compile highly targeted databases of contacts and an integrated API crawls, extracts and verifies the email addresses of your prospects. Additionally, an integrated CRM allows you to launch drip mailing campaigns with powerful retargeting and funnel generation.

The Story Behind How Pocket Hit 20M Users with 20 People | First Round Review,http://firstround.com/review/the-story-behind-how-pocket-hit-20m-users-with-20-people/,"If save-for-later service Pocket had a spirit animal, it’d be the American field ant. Like the insect, the startup supports that which is many times its own size. It serves its 20 million registered users — who have saved over 2 billion articles and videos for later — with a team of just 20 employees.

At the center of this supernatural ability and efficiency is founder and CEO Nate Weiner. Pocket just celebrated its eighth birthday — but for roughly half of the company’s existence, Weiner was the sole employee. On his own, he built and designed Pocket’s website, API, iPhone app and iPad app, and fielded support requests from his first few million users.

Pocket is proof that size of team doesn’t equal scale of impact. In this exclusive interview, Weiner explains why scaling a company doesn’t always mean increasing headcount (and burn). Instead, he shares the two ways startups can grow a business without a marketing or sales team, and the incredible advantages of staying small for focus, culture and trust. Any early-stage company that seeks to punch above its weight can benefit from Weiner’s exceptional (in more ways than one) experience with growth.

Nearly four years into Pocket, Weiner decided to raise money to turn his one-man-show into a team. How many people would he need? For someone who built the first version of Pocket on his own in a night, five people seemed like a lot. “I asked myself, ‘What the hell would five people do?’” Weiner says. “Evernote (which had made a bid to buy Pocket in its early, early days) employed around 60 people when I first started talking to them. I couldn’t fathom having a team that size. What would they work on? Why’s a team of ten working on what one person can do?”

Today, Pocket is in the process of moving into a new office to fit its now quickly growing team (targeted at two dozen by year-end), so it’s clear that success has shifted Weiner’s perspective, at least a little. Still, he maintains how Pocket’s sustained smaller size in its early years was formative to its long-standing winning streak. And even now, he doesn’t want any sudden moves to lose or dilute the very traits that got the company where it is today: focus and trust. Below, he shares how keeping a team small can be an invaluable guiding principle.

Force Focus with a Smaller Headcount — Either Real or Simulated

Management mantras harp on the importance of focus and staying nimble for startups. But they tend to leave practitioners to will clarity and agility into reality. Like any other startup, Pocket struggles with staying focused while prioritizing the many inbound or upcoming opportunities it’s always juggling. Unlike most companies, it views its small headcount as a means — not a limitation — to focus.

For the first quarter of this year, Pocket had over 20 projects on the docket across the entire company — that is, more projects than employees. “Focus is an enduring battle for a company of any size,” says Weiner. “If we were a larger company, we might’ve been tempted to elect a lead for each project, allocate engineers and push ahead on all fronts. But our limited resources prompt frequent reflection and rigorous prioritization.”

Pocket only completed one-fourth of its projects slated for the first quarter. With so much in motion, the team felt dispersed and directionless. “It didn't feel good,” says Weiner. “Then we got word of a marquee project: Mozilla wanted to build Pocket into every version of Firefox that people downloaded. That integration caused the entire company to focus on one thing. It took me back to the early days when we were just five people, and how we attacked one goal at a time with all of us behind it. We rallied together to do the integration quickly, all while furthering Pocket’s mission of giving more people access to the content they want for later enjoyment.""

If you lead a small startup, ask yourself: restrictions aside, would I put the entire company behind this project? If the answer is yes, find a way to do it. “With everyone on the Firefox project, we moved so much faster, the quality of the product was way better and people were amped up,” says Weiner. “Then we went on to the next project — with more momentum, coordination and energy than if we decided to divide and conquer our list of projects.”

If you’re over 100 employees, find a way to manufacture the same scenario. Think back to the time when your company could fit into one room, and ask yourself if you’d put everyone on the project if you could. If the answer is yes, consider deploying more reinforcements from your current team. “Even at 20, 30 or even 50 people, you should really just be focused on that one thing that needs to happen right now,” says Weiner.

“I understand that bigger companies cannot shift the same way startups can, but it’s keeping that instinct sharp and active that’s key,” says Weiner. “Personally, I know I need that focus forced on me. The more people you add, the easier it is to keep doing what’s not critically important. With a smaller team, it’s very hard not to stay focused. You constantly need to avoid doing what you want to do in the future for that which has to be done now.”

For companies of any size, Weiner suggests putting the full team on the most critical project every quarter. “Over the next 90 days, what’s going to be the project that makes the difference? Let’s just make sure that we hit that goal the best we can and then we can move onto the next project.”

Pocket is now shortening its project runway to under 30 days — especially for engineering sprints. “I can tell you where we're going six months from now, but we try to focus a month at a time. A small team enables us to operate this way,” says Weiner.

Condense Your Culture But Expand Your Skillset

At larger companies, entire roles or departments are charged with defining and preserving culture in order to absorb hundreds of new hires. As Pocket’s sole employee for its early years, Weiner was both the only creator and custodian of its culture. While he knew he eventually needed more than one person to scale the company, he didn’t want to lose the drive and grit that had landed him early success.

With a small headcount, Weiner was able to keep Pocket’s culture concentrated during its formative years. This was possible because its culture wasn’t a fuzzy concept — it meant trust, scrappiness and ownership. Weiner had years to discover and refine founder-culture fit with the same rigor that most apply to find product-market fit for their companies. After all, there’s a saying in tech that 80% of your eventual culture is your founder (literally their personality traits).

Think stews not salads when it comes to company culture. Start by letting a few choice ingredients simmer together. Then taste. You’ll have a better palate for what it delivers and lacks than if you toss it all together from the start.

This hard-earned clarity allows Weiner to confidently hire in his image while gradually growing the team and diversifying its skillset. “As with all startups, at some point you realize you can’t do it all to completion or to a high standard. For example, I really needed help with design,” said Weiner. “Nikki, our Head of Design, was the first hire. I had the engineering and product experience, but she brought the design chops that we needed to truly make a great product. She changed the black and yellow color scheme — that had somehow looked good to me at the time — to what Pocket looks like today. It's been vital to bring on people who own and value their part of Pocket as much as I have from the start. They’ve made it better than I could have.”

Keeping Pocket around 20 employees has allowed Weiner to not only personally filter for those he can trust, but also assemble a group capable of making decisions and operating without him. With a small team, those bonds and common world view form more quickly without complex hierarchies in the way. “As a technical founder, engineering was the hardest area to let go,” says Weiner. “Early on though, I remember when it finally clicked: We had an issue with our back-end. I suggested an idea on how to resolve it. The team noted it, and then went to another room to sort it out. The solution that they came up with was way better than mine. It was a great moment to realize how it was okay to let go, and that it often turns out better when there’s acknowledged and mutual trust.”

A small startup can use its size to force focus and better preserve culture as it grows, but these benefits are just the fuel for the work the team has to do. Its output — the actual product — can also scale without increasing headcount, but only through two channels. “The only way a product can grow from a team of our size is if your platform carries you or your users carry you,” says Weiner.

The advantage of being small is that you find ways to make people outside of your walls part of your company.

Here’s how Pocket develops, ships and publicizes its product through its platform and with the help of its loyal users:

Here’s How Your Platform Can Carry You

In the early days, Weiner made it his goal to embed Pocket in every corner of the web. The intent was to create an “amazing consumption experience” for as many people as possible across all of their devices, which meant the app itself had to be extremely flexible and scalable.

Without a sales or marketing team, Pocket made its app as simple and straightforward for other companies to learn about and integrate its service — which, in turn, has exponentially grown Pocket’s users. To date, the company has tallied over 2,000 integrations, among them Firefox, Twitter, Flipboard, and Kobo.

With strong partner feedback and enthusiasm, Pocket now seeks to grow as fast as it can through its platform. Weiner sees tons of opportunities, but there’s more out there than Pocket could possibly build with its current team — even if headcount doubled instantly.

As a small, fast-growing company, you can go on a hiring spree or lean on your platform. If you opt for the latter, here’s Weiner’s advice:

Make it dead simple and low-lift.

The team at Pocket relies on this question to make decisions: how can we make it simpler for all involved? For example, it’s now commonplace for startups to share their APIs, but Pocket takes it a step further. “Yes, the APIs that we build on as a company are the exact same APIs we give to every partner publicly. But can you help them with just a few lines of code?” asks Weiner.

Years ago, Weiner took on this challenge with the help of ShareKit, an open source Software Development Kit (SDK) that people could drop into their iOS apps. “I tried to make it literally one line of code for people to add Pocket and other popular services to what they were building.” says Weiner. “Companies could drop the line of code in and their app could share to any service like Twitter, Tumblr or Facebook. At the time, if you had to write the code from scratch on your own, it was weeks of work to set these things up. But I still wanted to make it simpler.” This is the same philosophy that guides Pocket today.

As much as possible, make it truly plug-and-play for others who want to build in your product. “If Twitter comes to us and wants to integrate Pocket, we’ve lost if it takes them a month to do it,” says Weiner. “They’re simply not going to do it. And I don’t blame them.”

Not requiring people to reinvent the wheel means first making sure what you’re working with is as simple as a wheel. If it is, they’ll use it and there won’t be much reinventing needed.

Structure integration as self-help.

Pocket’s platform mentality has been a huge part of its growth. Allowing companies to build on its platform easily has been the first step, but scale happens when they can do so independently. “We’ve completed thousands of integrations without any business development — and the overwhelming majority without any support,” says Weiner.

Simplicity has made it easy for partners to integrate Pocket, but the startup’s size has made it a necessity. “The deals with Kobo and Firefox only happened because we made it easy for them to self-serve,” says Weiner. “At first, Kobo asked us to integrate Pocket in two months. If our team of a dozen people (at the time) had to build it from scratch, it would have never happened. But we said, ‘Here’s our API.' Kobo was able to integrate Pocket within 14 days.”

For integration, the ideal is when companies can incorporate Pocket without ever reaching out to Weiner or his team. Pocket has found that its users typically request other apps to integrate the save-for-later service, which is what prompts new companies to learn about Pocket. “We’ve heard a few times that the number one feature request for apps is integrating Pocket. When companies look into it, they’re happy to check the request off the list on their own,” says Weiner. “That’s how Facebook Paper integrated Pocket. I had nothing to do with that — I just found out one day.”

Woo big partners tenaciously with your platform, then keep them with transparency.

Simple platform integration and self-service doesn’t mean that startups should go on autopilot. Pocket stays on the radar of strategic companies that it believes will benefit from its product. For example, the first time that Pocket reached out to Firefox it was still known as Read-it-Later. “We started as a Firefox extension and I was one of the extension app reviewers early on,” says Weiner. “We’ve built the type of culture where we share our story, data and updates early and along the way, so companies — from major content services to device manufacturers — understand what it’s like to be our partner from the beginning. We want them to truly know — and be able to point to proof — that we’re ready when they are. One day, it clicked and Mozilla called. It’s now fully integrated Pocket as the save-for-later service for its Firefox browser.”

Remember: getting an app or company on your platform marks the end of a deal, but the beginning of an official working relationship. For Pocket, channeling “generous transparency” is the way it retains its partners and continues to improve its product with such a small team. “We try to share knowledge as much as possible. We don’t try to hide anything. We tell Apple and Google what we’re seeing in the market when they’re working on their share sheets,” says Weiner. “As a result, it's made it really easy for us to actually start getting these deals done as people want to solve their save-for-later needs. They know who to turn to.”

The takeaway for lean startups is to construct a platform that can enable external parties to operate as extensions of your team: sales, engineering and business intelligence. In the case of Pocket, its platform is simple to integrate, built for self-service and brings with it an increasingly rich set of data, that when aggregated, benefits all its partnering companies. “What’s next is leveraging our user base. While we have a hundreds of companies integrating Pocket, we have millions of users,” says Weiner. “The question now is: how can we serve them and also help them carry us even further?”

Here’s How Your Users Can Carry You

“Think back to what it was like to watch television before DVR or streaming. Or what it felt like to hail a cab without Uber,” says Weiner. “Whenever you find a place that feels old, people get really passionate about it, because the new way has become so core to their experience and going back to the old way just feels broken. With Pocket, I think we’ve hit upon a very different way of using content on the web. We have users that, when they go into another app where they can’t save to Pocket, say, ‘Is this an ancient time? What’s going on here?’”

Small startups who have users expressing this degree of passion should not miss the opportunity to direct that energy from expression into creation for the benefit of the company. For Pocket, that’s meant getting users to lend a helping hand to product development. Here are the two ways that Pocket’s users are supporting its next generation of products.

Shift your Beta channel from delivery to conversation to co-creation.

When Pocket started, its release philosophy was about pushing out an airtight product to its users. The team would perfect every pixel before launch. “At the beginning, Pocket was a very waterfall-like product,” says Weiner. “We would deliver big releases about once a year. We’d go underground for six months and build something big and then we'd launch it. The releases were well received, but we suspected we should have been getting more out of our process.’”

Yet, after product-market fit, perfect is not only the enemy of good, but of growth. “Pocket is known as a very well-designed experience and app,” says Weiner. “While we want to keep that up, our development debates shifted from every nitpicking detail to how we open up and solve growth problems. As a small team at a growing company, we needed to tap into our users as collaborators, not just as beneficiaries.”

There comes a point for every startup when you’ve got to decide between perfection and progression. The first is a stable characteristic and the second is a dynamic conversation. Choose wisely.

Off the bat, that means having more frequent interactions with users. Getting them involved in product development isn’t just about opening the floodgates — it requires restructuring the way your team works. Pocket has moved to a faster release cycle to have more touchpoints with its users. “We're moving to a much faster cadence. Our sprints are a few weeks long and we’re closing in on a five to six week release cycle. For the team, it’s a far cry — and a cultural shift — from trying to get everything perfect before the public sees it. Now, we know there are bugs in what we ship, but now we aren’t the only ones squashing them.”

This approach was especially critical to Pocket 6.0, a prototype that the company uses internally. The team estimated that a full, public-ready version would take nine months to put out. “We were delighted by the beta and didn’t want our limitations to delay our users from experiencing it, too,” says Weiner. “So we decided to break it all apart. We laid out the five to six different releases that’d strategically get us there over a six week release cycle. So far, it’s felt good to get it out there, even if it’s piece by piece. We're getting feedback and signal back really fast. We listen, respond and incorporate it all. We also ship at the same time so users know they’re being heard — they’re like our remote team.""

If you have one arrow and you shoot and miss, you're screwed. If you can continually re-aim until you get to the target, that gives you a much better look at the bullseye.

Used correctly, a Beta channel can give your team great feedback and allow your users to direct the product. Even if you haven’t hired, you’ll feel like you have more manpower to hit milestones and additional insights into fast-moving markets. “After our last fundraise, we set a lot of important milestones, especially around getting additions to the platform built out,” says Weiner. “We know that we want to get them out there to validate and prove them in the market. The sooner that we can do that, the better. The beta channel’s the way forward for Pocket and the way in for our users.”

Use surveys to learn from ""the PMs"" among your users.

From the beginning, Weiner was struck by the enthusiasm and loyalty of Pocket users. “Our users love this product. I'm always blown away by how avid and vocal our fans can be,” says Weiner. “We get emails all the time from people writing in to say, ‘Hey. I don't have a bug. I just wanted to tell you guys that you’re awesome.’”

To fully engage this type of fanbase, use tools to solicit and leverage their support. Pocket has used surveys to not only collect feedback but also to directly guide its product roadmap. “We’re actually just reviewing 600 responses from a survey that we put out in our beta version of Pocket,” says Weiner. “Our support team is having conversations with people directly inside the product. We’ve actually received more feedback than ever through this channel.”

Many startups use surveys as an engagement tool, and casually treat the results as a byproduct. Don’t just listen, really hear what’s being said and how. “I always remind the team to look past the basic gist of the results,” says Weiner.

When users give you feedback on an obstacle, they almost always give you an idea on how to solve it.

""They don’t just say, 'I hate that this is the case.' If you keep reading, they’ll often include, 'You should let me pin this or swipe it away.' It may not be the solution in the end, but it will better define the challenge, which gets you closer to a solution.”

For example, Pocket now has two tabs, “My List” and “Recommendations,” at the top of the app. Results from the survey indicated that people wanted to swipe between the two lists, but that many users couldn’t reach their finger all the way to the top. “That was insightful, but it was also just one solution,” says Weiner. “The other option may be a standard UI convention on iOS, where you can bring the tab bar down to the bottom. All of sudden now, that's within reach of your thumb. But then, you also have to think about Facebook or other places where the new functionality may not be discoverable for a lot of users and many will have the same problem. If you jump to the first, second or tenth solution, you’re missing the point of fully grasping the need of implementing swipeable tabs.”

Lastly, when running surveys, keep in mind these three tips from Weiner:

Segment your users into buckets . Pocket has divided its user base into “casual,” “core,” and “inactive.” The team makes sure to send surveys to a group within each category to ensure they’re learning from a representative sample.

Lower the bar for participation . Pocket makes sure its surveys are easy to complete, which means they are less than five minutes long. Oftentimes, they’re even shorter. For the most part, the team prefers releasing two-questions surveys frequently than a ten-question survey released occasionally.

Drop in surveys at multiple junctures. Pocket continues to experiment with where and how it surveys users. Like most apps, there’s a send feedback button (in beta for Pocket) that is a passive channel. Or an email will capture those who may not open the app every day. Also, after five minutes of inactivity in the app, Pocket may pop up with a live chat and ask: “Hey. Everything OK?”

Using tools to engage users, like surveys and Beta channels, and creating easy, low-lift ways for partners to extend and build on your platform are ways to scale your company without growing your headcount. That’s how Pocket continues to deliver despite its size. However, now that Pocket’s partners and users are becoming more active in shaping the future, they’re also influencing the startup’s definition of success.

“Back before we raised money, I kept saying that save for later is a system-level feature that needs to built into browsers and operating systems. People told me that would never happen. Years later we’re built into Firefox,” says Weiner. “Our strategy has been to first create a way to capture anything you find and want to save — regardless of the app or service — and get embedded with the partners to make that universal. Then it’s to create an amazing set of tools to consume content. This has given us incredible insights on information consumption and, soon, how to solve its challenges. There’s always a next goal, but it’s the same question that drives us: How do we help people get all the great stuff that’s out there?”

The key for Pocket — or any startup — is to tackle a colossal and ambitious goal with leverage. “Right now, we really want to get our platform to scale even more and reach as many people as possible,” says Weiner. “We want them to not only enjoy what we create, but help us build it. If for each Pocket employee, there’s a hundred partners and millions of users to help, we’ll have the muscle to make it all happen.”"

 Home Mergers and Acquisitions Classification / Types of Mergers Classification / Types of Mergers 
 Mergers  and acquisitions are the ways in which businesses get combined. They can be little intricate to understand all the legal and tax issues surrounding the deals.  Mergers and acquisitions  are two different business combinations, although they are thought of as a generic term. Let us look at the types of mergers and acquisitions, the ways the companies can do business combinations. Table of Contents 1  Definition of Merger 2  Basis of Classifications / Types of Mergers: 2.1  Integration Form 2.2  Relatedness of Business Activities 3  Statutory Merger 4  Subsidiary Merger 5  Consolidation Merger 6  Horizontal Merger 7  Vertical Merger 7.1  Backward Integration 7.2  Forward Integration 8  Conglomerate Merger 9  Market Extension Mergers 10  Product Extension Mergers 11  Complementary or Supplementary Merger 12  Hostile or Friendly Merger 13  Arm’s Length Merger 14  Strategic Merger Definition of Merger A merger is a business transaction where an acquiring company  takeovers  the target company as a whole. This results in only one company remaining after the merger. The smaller target company loses its existence and becomes a part of the bigger acquiring company. Basis of Classifications / Types of Mergers: Mergers can be differentiated into various types depending on the following: Integration Form Mergers can be classified depending on how both the companies physically combine themselves in the transaction to form one entity. Relatedness of Business Activities Mergers can be classified depending on how the business activities of both companies relate to each other.  The economic function and the purpose of the transaction define the types of mergers. Classification by the Form of Integration:   The mergers can be classified as follows on the basis of forms of integration: Statutory Merger A statutory merger is one in which all the  assets and liabilities  of the smaller company is acquired by the bigger (acquiring) company. As a result, the smaller target company loses its existence as a separate entity. Company A + Company B = Company A Subsidiary Merger A subsidiary merger is one in which the target company becomes a subsidiary of the bigger acquiring company. This happens because the target company may have a known brand or a strong image which would make sense for the acquiring company to retain. Company A + Company B = (Company A + Company B) Consolidation Merger A consolidation merger is one in which both the companies lose their identity as separate entities and become a part of a bigger new company. This is generally the case with both the companies being of the same size. Company A + Company B = Company C Classification on the Basis of Relatedness of the Business Activities: The mergers can be classified as follows on the basis of relatedness of the business activities: Horizontal Merger A merger that happens between companies belonging to the same industry. The companies have businesses in the same space and are generally competitors to each other. A  horizontal merger  is a feature of an industry which consists of a large number of small firms / fragmented industry. The level of competition is high and the post-merger synergies and gains are much higher for companies in such industries. The motivation behind such merger is  economies of scale  and control of bigger market share. Vertical Merger A  vertical merger  is a merger between companies that produce different goods or offer different services for one common finished product. The companies operate at different levels in the supply chain of the same industry. The motivation behind such mergers is cost efficiency, operational efficiency,  increased margins  and more control over the production or the distribution process. There are two types of vertical mergers: Backward Integration A vertical integration where a company acquires the suppliers of its raw materials. Forward Integration A vertical integration where a company acquires the distribution channels of its products. Conglomerate Merger A merger between companies that operate in completely different and unrelated industries. A pure  conglomerate merger  is between companies with totally nothing in common. A mixed conglomerate merger is between companies looking for a market or product extensions. Market Extension Mergers A merger between companies that have same products to offer but the markets are different. The reason behind such mergers is access to bigger markets and an increase in client base. Product Extension Mergers A merger between companies that have different but related products but the markets are same. Such mergers allow the companies to bundle their product offerings and approach more consumers. Other Classifications: Besides the above classifications, there are other characteristics of the deals also, that may further define the types of mergers: Complementary or Supplementary Merger A complementary merger aims at compensating for some limitation of the acquiring company. The  acquisition  of target company may be an attempt to strengthen a ‘process’ or enter a new market. A supplementary merger is one in which the target company further strengthens the acquiring company. The target may be similar to the acquiring company in this case. Hostile or Friendly Merger A merger can be hostile or friendly depending on the approval of its directors. If the board of directors and the managers of the company are against the merger, it is a hostile merger. If the merger is approved by them, it is a friendly merger. 
 Arm’s Length Merger This type of a merger is a merger that is approved both by the disinterested directors and the disinterested stockholders. Strategic Merger A merger of a target company with an aim of strategic holding over a longer term. An acquirer may pay a premium to target in this case. Conclusion: A business combination gets complex not only with the legal issues but also with the type of a merger. A merger can vary according to the way companies come together or their economic functions. It is important to understand the type of merger to appreciate the intricacies involved. 1,2 References 1.

 What is it? 
 Framework/theory 
 Porter's Five Forces of Competitive Position Analysis were developed in 1979 by Michael E Porter of Harvard Business School as a simple framework for assessing and evaluating the competitive strength and position of a business organisation. 
 This theory is based on the concept that there are five forces that determine the competitive intensity and attractiveness of a market. Porter’s five forces help to identify where power lies in a business situation. This is useful both in understanding the strength of an organisation’s current competitive position, and the strength of a position that an organisation may look to move into. 
 Strategic analysts often use Porter’s five forces to understand whether new products or services are potentially profitable. By understanding where power lies, the theory can also be used to identify areas of strength, to improve weaknesses and to avoid mistakes. 
 Porter’s five forces of competitive position analysis: 
 
 
   
 The five forces are: 
 1. Supplier power.  An assessment of how easy it is for suppliers to drive up prices. This is driven by the: number of suppliers of each essential input; uniqueness of their product or service; relative size and strength of the supplier; and cost of switching from one supplier to another. 
 2. Buyer power.  An assessment of how easy it is for buyers to drive prices down. This is driven by the: number of buyers in the market; importance of each individual buyer to the organisation; and cost to the buyer of switching from one supplier to another. If a business has just a few powerful buyers, they are often able to dictate terms. 
 3. Competitive rivalry . The main driver is the number and capability of competitors in the market. Many competitors, offering undifferentiated products and services, will reduce market attractiveness. 
 4. Threat of substitution.  Where close substitute products exist in a market, it increases the likelihood of customers switching to alternatives in response to price increases. This reduces both the power of suppliers and the attractiveness of the market. 
 5. Threat of new entry.  Profitable markets attract new entrants, which erodes profitability. Unless incumbents have strong and durable barriers to entry, for example, patents, economies of scale, capital requirements or government policies, then profitability will decline to a competitive rate. 
 Arguably, regulation, taxation and trade policies make government a sixth force for many industries. 
 What benefits does Porter’s Five Forces analysis provide? 
 Five forces analysis helps organisations to understand the factors affecting profitability in a specific industry, and can help to inform decisions relating to: whether to enter a specific industry; whether to increase capacity in a specific industry; and developing competitive strategies. 
 
 Actions to take / Dos 
 Actions to Avoid / Don'ts 
 
 Use this model where there are at least three competitors in the market 
 Consider the impact that government has or may have on the industry 
 Consider the industry lifecycle stage – earlier stages will be more turbulent 
 Consider the dynamic/changing characteristics of the industry 
 
 
 
 Avoid using the model for an individual firm; it is designed for use on an industry basis

 Analysis of the Indian business environment 
 Download full case study 
 In the June 2010 issue of Financial Management magazine, the Five Forces model was applied to the emerging Indian business environment in comparison with more developed markets. The analysis found that factors such as state protectionism and a lack of infrastructure are greater barriers to entry in India than they are in more developed nations, where market forces are more powerful. 
 The analysis highlighted many issues affecting competition in emerging economies and compared them to those that are more prevalent in more developed markets. 
 One factor that could play a crucial role in India is public opinion, which exerts a considerable influence on the government. A good example of this is a campaign by local retailers against Walmart, who feel that the arrival of the US retail giant could put them out of business. Walmart has made huge investments in India, but is having to find ways around stringent regulations that prevent it from doing things as basic as putting its brand name on stores.

 Top 10 Must-Have Skills for Startup Success 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Take a look at the  evoma.com  home page. It’s a resource page for businesses, divided into sections –  thinking of starting a business ,  starting a business ,  running a business , and  growing a business . Each category requires a different set of skills and has its own set of business challenges.  
 But what are the skills you need, as a startup founder, to go from the first section to the last one? How do you get from thinking about starting a business to a stage where you are figuring out how to grow a successful business?  
 This is the topic of this post – the 10 must-have skills you need for startup success. It’s a top 10 list for sure, but more importantly, it’s a logical sequence of the skills you need. 
 1. Conceptualise ideas and turn them into commercially viable products. 
 Everyone has ideas, but the hard part is converting them into a real business with a commercially viable product.  
 By far the easiest and best way to test the viability of your idea as a business is to come up with a product demonstration and try to raise funding for it. Bankers and venture capitalists are shrewd enough to tell you if your idea and product is any good. 
 2. Build and test your product / service. 
 You don’t necessarily need to have the skills to build a demonstration piece by yourself if you have an idea. You can make do with the skill to find interested collaborators on startup and entrepreneur communities such as Quirky that can help you do it.  
 3. Raise funding to go to market. 
 We have a huge collection of posts on the skills you need to have to raise  startup funding . 
 4. Hiring skills to bring the skills you don’t have to your startup. 
 Startup founders are expected to do everything from opening the office to product demonstration, sales and accounting. But if you don’t have certain skills that are required or the time to do it all by yourself, you need to have the hiring skills to find people who can do it for you. This may be a partner or partners. You can also hire employees if you have raised enough funding to cover their wages.  
 5. Inspire your employees to walk on coals for you.  
 A startup that has enough cash is, by definition, not a startup anymore. You have to burn cash and do it all a lot faster than your established competitors to grow. There are never enough employees to handle all aspects of a newly launched startup, so you need to inspire your employees to work all hours of the day and night to get things done. If you can’t do this, and your employees are clocking in and out on time, then your startup has a less than stelllar chance of growing into a success. 
 6. Selling skills to get your first customers. 
 As a new startup, the only sales team you have is you. You have to learn to sell your own product and find customers willing to pay for it. Once you have that first set of customers, it becomes easier to build on that, and you can even start hiring salespeople. 
 7. Networking skills to meet clients and business partners. 
 Startup founders, especially in metros like Bangalore, Mumbai and Chennai, have to rely on their networking skills at events and conferences in order to connect with large new clients and business partners. If you don’t attend these events on a weekly basis, you risk being left out of the startup ecosystem that works so well to help startups grow faster than in smaller cities. 
 8. Delegating skills to get work done on time. 
 Your startup is your entire life, and you are expected to work every waking hour. But even that’s not enough if you try to do it all by yourself.  
 Get partners, hire talent, and learn to delegate in order to get the work done on time. 
 9. Scale your startup to reach new markets. 
 Once you have built a sustainable business that is generating a steady stream of revenue, the next step is to scale your startup to reach other markets. This may be another branch in your own city, or expansion to other cities. If you are an Internet or tech startup with a virtual product, it’s time to start scaling your marketing and sales team.  
 10. Skill to start all over again if you fail. 
 The 9 skills mentioned above are surely necessary for growing a startup from an idea to a success story. But the one last thing you need, above all else, is the ability to get up and start all over again – if you fail. 
 The most successful startup founders are usually serial entrepreneurs, who have tried many times before. Sometimes they fail, but they start learning how to win. That’s the most essential skill you need to have for startup success.

Written By : Ayat Shukairy 86 SHARES Linkedin Twitter Facebook   Editor Note:  We highly recommend that you implement the different ideas in this blog post through  AB testing . Use the guide to conduct AB testing and figure out which of these ideas in the article works for your website visitors and which don’t.  Download Invesp’s “ The Essentials of Multivariate & AB Testing ” now to start your testing program on the right foot. “Instant 20% boost in online sales and revenue, after changing the color of a button.” This type of quote may be misleading about the true magical powers of  website conversion rate optimization . The right CRO methodology can provide incredible results, but you’ll be just as amazed by the process to achieve these results through the fact-based, data-driven scientific approach we will bring to you in this guide. Let’s start with basic definitions for  online conversion rate  and  conversion rate optimization . What is Online Conversion Rate? Conversion rate  is the percentage of visitors who complete a desired action on a website, during a time period. Any valuable engagement your visitors make may count as a desired action, as long as it fulfills your webpage’s goal. Remember, every page should have a primary goal. You can choose to measure the number of visitors who: purchase a product sign up for a newsletter subscribe to a software hire a service download a free e-book fill out a ‘contact’ us form answer a survey give a feedback take any action a page is designed to encourage. By measuring conversion rates, you find out if your pages are persuading visitors to take the action you want them to take on the page. The higher the conversion rates, the better your design and copy are reaching out to qualified prospects. There are many goals, thus conversions rates, that you can track on your website. If you are an ecommerce website, your website conversion rate is the number of monthly orders your receive divided by the number of visitors that come to your website. At the same time, each page on your website has at least two conversion rates (if not more). Let’s take your product pages on an ecommerce website, the goal from these pages it get visitors to click on “the add to cart” button. And of course, the final goal is to get these visitors to place an order (convert on the website). So, product pages have two conversion goals: Micro conversion rate for product pages  is total clicks on the “add to cart” button divided by the number of visitors who visit the product pages. Macro conversion rate for product pages  is total orders for the website divided by the number of visitors who visit the product pages. In numbers, you need to determine a period and account for the total numbers of visitors and desired actions they took in this same period. Let’s say your e-commerce receives 200,000 visitors in one month and processes 20,000 orders in the same period. Your website conversion rate   = 20,000/200,000 = 10%. Of those 200,000 visitors, only 50,000 make it all the way to the product pages. Of these 50,000 visitors, 10,000 visitors click on the “add to cart” button. Product pages micro conversion rate   = 10,000/50,000 = 20%. Product pages macro conversion rate   = 20,000/50,000 = 40% The same concept applies if you are SaaS website. Your website conversion rate is the total number of monthly subscriptions divided by the total website monthly visitors. The SaaS pricing page, where you list the different plans for your product, has two conversion rates: SaaS pricing page micro conversion rate:  total number of visitors to click on the “subscribe” button on the page divided by the number of visitors who visit the pricing page. SaaS pricing page macro conversion rate:  total number of visitors who “subscribe”  divided by the number of visitors who visit the pricing page. Let’s say that your SaaS website gets 20,000 visitors per month and generates 500 subscriptions. Your website conversion rate   = 500/20,000 = 2.5%. Of those 20,000 visitors, only 1,000 make it to the pricing page and of these 1,000 visitors, 750 click on the subscribe button. Your pricing page conversion rate is = 750/1,000 = 75%.  SaaS pricing page micro conversion rate =   750/1,000 = 75%. SaaS pricing page macro conversion rate =  500/1,000 = 50% What is Conversion Rate Optimization? Conversion rate optimization  is a marketing optimization process that follows a framework to increase the percentage of visitors who complete a website’s goal. Conversion optimization analyzes the behavior of visitors and focuses on what motivates a particular market segment to engage in a certain way with specific marketing elements. Conversion Rate Optimization is focused on persuading more of your website visitors to take the desired action you want them to take on a webpage, website or within a campaign. At a very high level, the CRO process involves: Conducting a  heuristic evaluation  for the site Conducting  qualitative research  and  user  behavior analysis Conducting  quantitative research Conducting  competitive analysis Prioritizing problem areas on the site and  creating a conversion roadmap  for your website (what pages need to be fixed) Creating a testing hypothesis Creating new designs based on the testing hypothesis Conducting  AB testing  (or  multivariate testing ) Analyzing the testing results As you read through the different chapters in this guide, you will learn about each of these steps in depth. So, what is Conversion Testing? Conversion Testing is the process of conducting an  AB or multivariate test  to increase the website conversion rate. An iterative process by nature, CRO helps you in making assumptions about your website visitors and then testing these assumptions to measure how your market actually responds. As a long-term process, CRO achieves sustainable, repeatable, and consistent increases on conversion rates through researching, testing, and analyzing visitors’ behaviors on your website. A good CRO program increases your site’s revenue month to month, reaching significant cumulative annual growth. The best part? This result optimizes your current website traffic. More conversions, without the need of increasing site traffic. The annual uplift in profits alone  could  should justify a CRO program implementation. But conversion optimization goes beyond the metrics and profits. When performed correctly, CRO becomes a way of discovering more about your visitors and customers as well as your website and your company. A good program can give you precious insights to apply to other areas of your organization. CRO is a new mindset. If you think you know  everything  about your customers, then CRO is not for you. CRO is also not for you if you don’t set the  right expectations . Don’t expect to change the color of a button and instantly receive more orders, forever. It is not going to happen overnight. You won’t set up a test or two and immediately achieve a permanent monthly uplift. CRO is a process to enable data-driven choices to increase conversions. No guesswork. No magic. CRO is a culminating feature to your overall marketing strategy. Summing up, CRO is a system to increase the percentage of visitors who take the desired actions of a webpage data-driven and focused on results researching, testing, and analyzing visitors’ behaviors on your website a way of discovering more about your visitors and customers a new mindset a long-term commitment CRO is not guesswork magic for you, if you think you know everything about your customers for you, if you don’t set the right expectations What is a Long-term Commitment in a CRO Program? If ‘long-term’ has been mentioned too many times already and started haunting your plans of increasing conversions, check the short video below. You’ll understand that you may see initial uplifts, but the long-term commitment to CRO will help you continue to gain increases overtime, never missing a beat with your visitors. In this video, we talk about long-term commitment in CRO programs, during one of our webinars, and provide a timeframe to kick start projects. Video Source –  How to Run a Successful Conversion Rate Optimization Program by Invesp What is More Important: Increasing Website Traffic or Converting Its Existing Traffic? So, you are looking for ways to improve the revenue your website brings in every month. It sounds all too familiar: limited budget, limited resources and a website that does not generate enough revenue. What marketing budgeting meeting hasn’t suffered through figuring it all out? But where does all that place CRO in the hierarchy? Some things to consider: If your online conversions are low, conventional wisdom tells you to bring more people to your site. It is a numbers game. The more visitors your website has, the greater the revenue it generates. Companies that provide  conversion optimization services  would disagree with this premise. But, just like many other realities online, the truth is somewhere in between. Though bringing more traffic works as well to improve your  website revenue , this chapter of our guide explains why  converting  current traffic is a better option and lists five reasons many online companies still neglect increasing website conversion rates. Needing help to decide whether increasing traffic or  site conversion rates  is the best option to improve your bottom line at this point in your business? This chapter will also explain the four rules of thumb to help you make the best decision. Why Bringing More Traffic Works? There is no disputing the fact. Assume your current site only converts 2% of its traffic to customers or leads. If you are able to keep the same conversion rate when more potential customers visit your site, doubling your current site traffic will double your revenue. At least, that is the theory. You need to keep a couple of things in mind when trying to acquire new traffic. You must maintain the same  quality  of traffic when bringing new visitors to your website. If you just attract any traffic to your site, you can severely  lower your conversion rate . Are you able to maintain the same quality traffic? That will depend on what you are currently doing in terms of traffic generation. If you are already ranking in the top three for most of your key terms, both organically and in paid, acquiring new traffic  may  require your focus on possible broader new terms. In that case, you run the risk of spending money in SEO and PPC and not seeing immediate results from that investment (lots of trial and error involved). How About Bringing More Social Media Visitors to the Website? Would bringing in more visitors from  social media channels help increase conversions  on your site? “Social media traffic is junk traffic. It simply does not convert,” you might have heard. Social media brings a different  type  of traffic that represents lower conversion rates compared to other traffic sources. But it still is a relevant marketing commitment. Social media users are surfing websites and interacting socially on these websites. They are not thinking about converting. When they click on your ad or post, they are rarely in the mindset that allows them to convert. The browsing mindset does not make them less valuable. They are just in a different stage of the buying funnel. As valuable as  social media is for your business , in terms of effective, sustainable and consistent increase in sales, you should focus on an approach to convert current visitors, not on bringing in more browsers. Why Converting Current Traffic is a Better Option? Invesp research indicates that 70% of your site visitors are interested in your product or service. The remaining 30% either landed on your website by mistake or are merely looking for information and not interested in converting. If 70% of your visitors are interested in converting, it is just a matter of persuading them to become actual customers instead of mere browsers. In traditional brick-and-mortar stores, the primary focus is on converting current traffic. Why?  Increasing conversion rates  for an offline store usually involves salesforce training, incentives, merchandising, and store design. It would not make sense to suggest that the store should try to generate more foot traffic because sales are too low for the current levels of traffic. Online, the story is quite different. Over the last fifteen years, most online marketing has focused on increasing website traffic as opposed to converting existing traffic. That does not make it the right thing to do. And it actually remains as a perplexing paradox for the CRO industry. As companies try to acquire new traffic and bring more visitors to their website, they find themselves expanding their targeting. They either: Target untested new traffic sources or Target more general terms In both cases, they are driving more visitors to their website, but they are doing so at the expense of the quality of these visitors. So, as the traffic increases, their conversion rate drops. 10 Reasons Why Converting Current Traffic is Better Than Acquiring More Traffic 1.  Learn more about yours visitors’ behavior.  Hypotheses and testings give you a better panorama about customers’ behavior on your page. 2.  Discover more about your customers.  Deeper than recognizing just the activities on one page, you can develop insights on how to address customers’ needs in multiple touch points. 3.  Keep track of user’s’ behavior.  You can gather important data on all stages of the buyer’s journey. 4.  Provide to customers what they want.  From de-cluttered design to clear copy, you can find how to offer the best experience to customers and visitors. 5.  Improve your website.  With all the information you gather, you can update your site. 6.  Position your brand on the market.  Strengthen your brand with sharp design, effective copy, and higher conversion rates. 7.  Get more qualified leads.  Reach the right prospects, not random browsers. 8.  Spend less.  To increase traffic, you need to invest more money in your campaigns. 9.  Increase in profit.  Increase revenue with more conversions. 10.  Continue growing.  The right CRO approach can bring sustainable, repeatable, and consistent increases. So, Where Should You Start? Increase Traffic Or Increase Website Conversion Rates? Simple answer:  what has a better impact on your bottom line? If you have the budget, do both for maximum benefit and growth. However, we are not going to leave you hanging. Here are some good rules of thumb that you should consider: 1st Rule:  If your website, landing page or campaign gets less than 200 conversions per month, you should focus on increasing your visitors. Why is that? As you see in the steps we outlined above, conducting split testing (AB testing) is a critical step to determine if your new website designs increase conversion rates or not. With less than 200 conversions a month, you will not be able to conduct an effective split testing program. 2nd Rule:  If your website, landing page or campaign gets more than 200 conversions but less than 500 conversions per month, you should start with a conversion rate optimization program. Why is that? Because, with that many conversions, you will be able to start A/B testing, by introducing one to two challengers against the original design. 3rd Rule:  If your website, landing page or campaign gets more than 500 conversions but less than 1,000 conversions per month, you should definitely focus on increasing your website conversion rate. Why is that? With more than 500 conversions, you are able to start a solid A/B testing program introducing four to seven challengers against the original design. 4th Rule:  If your website, landing page or campaign gets more than 1,000 conversions per month and you have not done any conversion optimization, then you have made a huge mistake! Remember, a whopping 70% of your visitor’s come to your site with some sort of intent to purchase. You’re missing out on a lot of convertible, targeted traffic. Why is that? With more than 1,000 conversions, you are able to start a solid  A/B or MVT testing  program. Every month you do not focus on CRO, you are leaving money on the table. It is money that will never come back. As I wrote this article with the different recommendations, one of our junior staff members came to ask me if the recommendations above are correct or not. I told him, yes these are the recommendations we have been giving companies for over 10 years. He says, “but that is not the industry standard.” I ask, “why?” He says,” There are many of our competitors who publish case studies showing clients with less than 200 conversions per month” Does my recommendation mean that if you have less than 200 conversions per month, you should never consider CRO? No, you can still do CRO. However, you must understand that you will not be able to run AB testing at a fast scale. Most of your testing will be done to optimize micro conversions. That is not necessarily a bad thing. But, you must have the right mindset. Why Don’t Many Online Companies Focus On Increasing Website Conversion Rates? These are the five main reasons many online companies do not focus on increasing their conversions: 1. Increasing website traffic is easier than increasing website conversion rates:  To increase your offline sales, you train your staff, re-organize the store, run incentives, and conduct customer surveys. In contrast, it is a lot easier to increase your PPC campaign budget or daily spend; thus increasing the traffic to your site. Setting up paid campaigns requires little effort for most companies. Converting the new traffic these campaigns bring is much more challenging and requires a person or team to put together all the pieces. 2. Many companies failed at conversion optimization:  We see it all the time. Companies launch a new conversion rate program hoping to increase their online revenue. They jump into testing right away. They do NOT follow a methodology in optimization. They randomly select pages to test, randomly test elements on these pages and do not analyze the results of their testing program. A few months later, after a few failed experiments, they shut down the program. If you think about it, there is not a problem with optimization in this scenario. There is a problem with the way these companies approach conversion optimization. Random marketing does not work in any campaign. Good results require consistent and repeatable methodology. 3. Increasing conversion rates is complex:  Increasing your website revenue requires you to anticipate and understand visitors’ cognitive progression (what information your visitors are expecting to see) as well as to provide them with that information. It requires you to focus on human behavior on your website, which is not an easy task. Many companies shy away from addressing this problem. However, would you stop doing something you know can help your business just because you think it is complex? Wouldn’t it make more sense to put the time and effort to understand it and reap the benefits from it? 4. Increasing conversion rates requires commitment : Just like any other type of marketing program, conversion optimization is a long-term commitment. No shortcuts here. CRO is not a light switch you turn on and off. Many companies fear pursuing a new activity unknown to them, but, ultimately, this is a numbers game. It is about calculating how much money CRO will require you to invest and what return you should expect. And that’s why every company should ask themselves: does the return justify the investment? 5. The Ego problem:  CRO gives your visitors a voice in the design process of your website. The more analysis and testing you conduct, the larger the voice of the visitor will be on your website. That is a good thing. Well, most of the time. Someone in your team (might be you, your designer, your CEO) may discover the vast contrast between his ideas of what works best and the visitors’ actual interests. That is not always an easy pill to swallow. What’s worse is when the visitor’s voice points to solutions that go against the current trends. Do you still give them what they want or keep your site trendy and following the latest developments?

My Muses for Brainstorming Startup Ideas,http://www.sachinrekhi.com/my-muses-for-brainstorming-startup-ideas,"As today marks my first day as an Entrepreneur -in- Residence at Trinity Ventures , I'm spending a lot of time thinking about how to formalize my process for starting a new venture. Every startup goes through phases including brainstorming ideas, selecting evaluation criteria, performing due diligence on top ideas, picking a winner, deciding on a corporate structure , putting together the team, evaluating funding options, and more. While the popular press often glamorizes the startup story as an epiphany moment from an opportunistic individual that grows to a successful corporate behemoth, I prefer a much more systematic approach to entrepreneurship (and life in general, for that matter). As I begin this journey myself, I thought I'd document my new venture process along the way, share it with all of you, and hopefully hear from you on your own thoughts.Often one of the earliest steps in forming a new venture is coming up with the idea. I won't argue that this should necessarily be the first step though, since in my previous venture Anywhere.FM we picked the team before the idea and that was the right choice for us. I also won't argue that it is necessarily the most important step, because while a startup needs a great idea, it's not without great execution that an idea can become a successful endeavor.I'm often asked where I come up with all my ideas, as I'm typically chock-full of potential ideas percolating in my head. I have a variety of sources of inspiration that help me put together laundry lists of potential startup opportunities. Before I dive into my muses though, I think what's important to realize is that the best idea brainstorming happens outside of any specific brainstorming phase. Good idea generation is like a muscle that you are constantly flexing. It's a mindset and attitude towards the problems you face everyday and your ability to effect change. While some people are innately curious and problem solvers, I still think like any muscle, this skill is something that can exercised and improved.I'm personally innately curious. But what has been a huge boon for me was learning to program on my first computer, an Apple IIc , when I was in middle school. I quickly learned BASIC and fell in love with the idea that I could make things. In the early days it was often games to amuse myself (which is what typically attracts many young boys to programming), but as time passed I started making more useful applications. One of the issues I had early on was quizzing myself on vocabulary words. I quickly wrote a program I called Vocabulary Master to provide me random word definitions, give me three attempts to guess the word correctly, and tell me the word if I failed to remember it. It was a very simple application, but was the foundation for my strong belief that I can solve real world problems through software. Ever since then I've constantly had a list of potential ideas. Oftentimes when something bothers me or I think that something can be improved, I add it to a list of potential projects (and I have to say that I love the fact that now I have an iPhone always in my pocket to record my ideas ). It's this critical lens of looking for ways to improve what you see every day and having the attitude that you can do something about it that I think makes for a great base of idea generation.Beyond that, there are specific muses I've used to help jump start my creative juices:I think often the best source of ideas comes from your area of expertise and the problems you face on a day-to-day basis in your career. You probably find yourself saying ""Why is this so hard? There has got to be an easier way"" every so often. It may be a product extension to your existing business's core products, or may be unrelated to the business, but a pain point you feel trying to get your job done. From my experience at imeem focusing on monetization, I've come up with countless pain points in trying to monetize social media and large publisher sites that could be fruitful startup opportunities.I think another very important exercise is analyzing macroeconomic trends and thinking about the opportunities it creates. What obviously comes to mind first these days is the recession, and I think a lot of startup opportunities will come out of that. Anywhere from helping people save money, find jobs, or tapping into the funds made available through the stimulus bill. But beyond the recession, I think there are a lot of other exciting market trends that are creating countless opportunities. Anywhere from the proliferation of APIs , to the rise of cloud platforms , to the opening up of mobile devices I believe there remains significant inefficiency in applying new technologies across multiple vertical applications. It behooves a startup to focus at least initially on a very specific application to prove out the model and to provide the best experience. But this creates significant opportunity for other startups to bring that existing technology innovation to new verticals and thus becomes a fruitful source of startup ideas. I often think about how trends in certain spaces can be applied to new segments. For example, can we bring the viral spreading of applications native to Facebook apps to iPhone applications? Or can we bring the successful virtual goods monetization model from social games to non-gaming sites If you have a specific area of interest or vertical segment that excites you, I think its hugely valuable to constantly keep up with the latest news in that area. These days its so easy to use Google Alerts to subscribe to daily feeds of the latest news, blogs, and search results of your topic of choice. I have these setup for various areas of interest, including open platforms and personal productivity.I think it's also very important to constantly be exposed to new startup ideas. When you hear people's ideas and their take on solving them, it definitely helps to get your own mind thinking about related opportunities in the space or at least helps to think critically about how they may have come up with such a solution. I daily skim TechCrunch as a great source of startup ideas. I think Jessica Livingston's Founders at Work was also a great case study of many different startup ideas.As I said, great entrepreneurs have this ability to constantly come up with ideas and potential solutions. I've been spending the last month catching up with a lot of my fellow entrepreneurs to not only chat about their business, but more importantly, interesting things that they have seen outside of their own startup. When an entrepreneur is busy executing against a specific idea, he is knee deep in one specific space. That doesn't mean though that he doesn't think about other ideas or have other ideas percolating in his head. I think its often great to tap into this creative thinking to spur some of your own ideas."
Agile Is The New Waterfall — A Followup,https://medium.com/swlh/agile-is-the-new-waterfall-a-followup-f1c0bcd2162e,"Agile Is The New Waterfall — A Followup - The Startup - Medium Sign in Get started Medium Things Submit Agile Is The New Waterfall — A Followup ayasin Follow Mar 22, 2016     ·       5    min read Several months ago I wrote an article  lamenting the fetishization of Agile  in place of the practice of  actually being  agile (aka process minimalism focused on production). It got a lot of traction (nearly 100K people bothered to take a look), a lot of misunderstanding, and even raised the ire of luminaries such as  Uncle Bob . People come from different backgrounds and different cultures. As a result, not all literary devices translate equally. This is my response to all the responses I received. Response: You Don’t Understand Agile; Agile isn’t Waterfall Of course Agile isn’t Waterfall. They’re very different processes that look almost nothing alike. Agile is waterfall in the way that it’s been incorrectly embraced as the hammer for every problem, without ever really thinking it through. People embracing it in this manner use Agile and often Scrum as a  cargo cult engineering process . They embrace the ceremonies (and they actually call them ceremonies) of Agile for the purpose of conducting the ceremonies. They assume that if they conduct the ceremonies, the gods of good software will reward them with good software. There’s no substitute for actually doing the work. Ceremonies for the sake of having ceremonies because “that’s what it means to be Agile” actively hinder getting work done. Response: You’re Picking on Consultants Guilty. I am picking on Agile consultancies. Why? Because they generally don’t work. Do some actually try to make your process better? Sure, I’d go as far as to say most act from a place of honesty. The problem is that they often introduce rules and process without understanding what actually needs to be done in your specific case. They want to be Agile. They want to hit the right words. While they understand how to run an “Agile shop” they often assume that making software is all the same. It’s not. A company that builds dating sites isn’t the same as a company that builds software for insulin pumps. That difference is huge in what it means to be agile. In order to accurately determine what the right process should be you need a good understanding of the problem space. This is something an Agile consultancy will never have. You’re  far  better off hiring a team lead that understands lean processes  as well as  your specific problem space. Response: Engineers Shouldn’t Be In Charge of Business Decisions True (for the most part). That’s not what “engineer driven development” means. By engineer driven development I mean engineers decide how long things will take and what resources need to be allocated to make an engineering project successful. They’re the only ones qualified to do so. Imagine you want to build a bridge across a river. You don’t say “we have 3 bags of concrete and 2 hours” then get a civil engineer to do the design. You get the civil engineer to do analyze the issue, and that informs how much time and how many materials you need. The engineer didn’t dictate where the bridge goes, how the city should grow or where businesses should be located relative to the bridge, but he did drive decisions related to the building of the bridge. Of course we shouldn’t exclude the civil engineer from all decisions about where the bridge should go either. For example if we want to build a bridge across the Pacific, we might want to engage the engineer early so he can say “that’s not a reasonable request” before we spend lots of money and time to determine if the populace will love it. In the same way, developers need to drive development decisions, but obviously these come with the constraints of how the business needs to grow. These constraints are defined by, or preferably, defined in conjunction with others. Compare this to “business driven development” where your resources and time constraints are made based exclusively on what’s ideal for the business and you’re expected to “get it done” in those constraints. Would you cross a bridge built under those conditions? Then why would you build software that way? Response: You Don’t Understand Story Points Fair enough, but I would argue that no one “understands” story points because they have no fixed lexical meaning. They end up meaning whatever is convenient in the moment, and often changing their meaning later (though you’re stuck with the number). I was in a planning meeting for a client where the following statements were all made inside of 30 minutes (naturally there was an Agile consultant running the meeting): Story points aren’t time, don’t try to estimate how long something will take. If a story is over 13, we need to break it down because it means it’s going to take more than a [2 week] sprint. Story points should be a single number that encompasses both effort and complexity. What? How does any of that make any sense? Points 1 and 2 are contradictory (and by the way, often used in this manner) and 3 tries to take 2 completely unrelated things and mash them into a single unitless measure (to which we’ll silently add a unit in our heads, normally time). If you insist on doing story points, use 2 numbers. One for complexity, and one for effort. Better yet, just guesstimate time in days. If you’re wrong, that’s OK, just roll with the punches. Response: You’re Just Bitter Because You’ve Never Seen Agile Done Right Capital A Agile can’t be done right because it’s more concerned with ceremony than advancement. There are shops doing minimal process right, if you work at one, great, Agile is the New Waterfall isn’t about you. The article was designed to give voice and perhaps offer some solutions to those suffering under  flaccid scrum  and other abuses of the buzzwords surrounding Agile. Response: You Suck and You’re Dumb Probably.

 Diversity vs. Inclusion: The Difference Between Them … and Why Businesses Need Both

 While “Diversity” and “Inclusion” often are used interchangeably, the difference between the two concepts is vitally important. 
 According to the  Society for Human Resource Management  (SHRM), studies show that teams or organizations with diverse qualities, experiences and work styles bring more ideas, perspectives and approaches to the table. On top of efforts to diversify their employee base, businesses may want to take note of the organizational success associated with the move toward inclusion. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When interviewers without standardized questions are left to decide which candidate to hire, their decisions tend to be subjective and unconsciously influenced by fixed thoughts on race, gender and ethnicity.

  Defining the difference 
 As defined by SHRM, diversity references the similarities and differences between individuals, accounting for all aspects of one’s personality and individual identity. It implies variety in characteristics like race, sex or  age . 
 Inclusion, however, refers to the efforts used to  embrace  those differences. It describes how much each person feels welcomed, respected, supported and valued. Inclusion is about seeing employees’ whole selves, recognizing that their differences make them uniquely qualified to contribute to the organization. 
 As  diversity and inclusion  expert Vernā Myers explains,  “Diversity is being invited to the party; inclusion is being asked to dance.” 
  How inclusion leads to organizational success 
   Consider this: According to the  McKinsey & Company  report  Delivering Through Diversity , ethnically and racially diverse companies are 33% more likely to outperform industry norms, while gender-diverse companies are 21% more likely to earn more revenue. Released in January 2018, the report suggests that gender, ethnic and cultural diversity correlate to financial performance, particularly when the diversity is within executive teams. 
 These high-performing companies acknowledge that commitment to an inclusive environment starts at the top. The McKinsey report’s authors note that progress on representation is a start and can be done relatively quickly, with the right initiatives (such as targeted recruiting), while embedding inclusion within the organization can take time to develop. 
 Inclusion stretches far beyond hiring employees with different backgrounds and ethnicities. It is a mindset in which employers actively provide each member of the workforce with equal access to opportunities. Organizations can begin to transition from diversity efforts to those of inclusion, to create an environment in which all employees can thrive and contribute their best work.

 Key Legal Documents for a Startup Company In order to legally incorporate your company, you are required to draft and maintain a series of legal documents. These documents are necessary so that the government, customers and members of the public can see basic information about your company and confirm that you are a properly organized business that follows the law. In addition to government-mandated documents, a few other legal documents are commonly used to protect your business from legal disputes with shareholders, employees or competitors. This article will introduce you to these documents and the need to keep them up to date in order to comply with governmental regulation of corporations.

 Key Legal Documents for a Startup Company   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Nearly all jurisdictions require that as part of the incorporation process, you provide the statutory authorities with the  Constitution of your Company  (previously known as Memorandum and Articles of Association). The constitution defines that rules by which your organization will be run, the company’s structure and the aims and the rules that govern it. In order to minimise the probability of disputes between shareholders, it is prudent to also draw up a Shareholder’s Agreement. 
 The set of documents that are needed by every company to comply with the laws of a jurisdiction is called the company register which is kept at either the registered office, or principal place of business. Over the life of your business, you may modify the rules by which you run your company. You are legally obligated to keep a record of these changes and update the documents that are part of the company register. If the business is ever sold, these statutory books (i.e. the company register) must be handed over to the new owner. 
 If your business produces or uses new technology or other intellectual property (IP) assets, it is essential to agree on who owns that IP, as it is the IP which will provide much of the long-term value to investors and other shareholders. Business owners also need to keep meticulous records of the employment agreements they enter into with individual staff members in order to avoid any confusion later on. 
 The Constitution of a Company Once an entrepreneur has made the decision to incorporate, the first document he or she will have to draw up is typically the Constitution of the Company (previously known as Memorandum and Articles of Association). Once signed by initial shareholders, the Constitution can be thought of as your company’s charter. It is a publicly-accessible record of your company’s objectives and structure. 
 As part of the Constitution, you are required to state your business’s address and legal name. The name of your business should be distinct so as to avoid legal troubles with companies with similar names. Your Constitution should also summarize the main objectives of your business and any ancillary objectives that are required to achieve the main ones. 
 The Constitution also records important initial financial information about your business and defines its relationship with shareholders. Typically, a liability clause will state that the shareholders are only liable for the business’s debts to the extent to which they are invested in the venture. Additionally, the Constitution lists a company’s assets, the amount of share capital and how it is divided up between shareholders. For larger companies with multiple categories of shares, the Constitution also sets out the types of shares initially offered by the company and their nominal value. 
 In most jurisdictions, the Constitution must be lodged with the local company registrar as part of the incorporation process, with the notable exception of the USA. In Singapore, you are required to provide the Constitution to the registration authority and Singapore provides a model Constitution that can be used by most companies. 
 The Constitution outlines the regulations of the company and contains provisions relating to how the company is to be governed. They are a contract between shareholders and the organisation. 
 The Constitution is required by law to set out the rights and duties of shareholders. There must be an agreed procedure for the allotment, transfer and forfeiture of shares. The extent to which shareholders can expect to receive dividends and enjoy voting rights is specified. The former is of particular interest to investors, as dividends are often a major long-term incentive for share ownership. In the event that all shares are cancelled and the company is shut down, the Constitution will detail the procedure that will be followed by stakeholders. 
 In addition to setting out the rules governing shareholders’ involvement in the company, the Constitution regulates the behaviour of the Board of Directors. This might include how directors and the chairperson should be elected, how frequently the board should meet and the quorum required for decision-making. The board is typically legally obliged to meet at least once per year for an Annual General Meeting (AGM). Any special rights held by the chairperson should also be specified at this point. 
 Statutory Books Over the course of your business’ life, you are required by law to keep an ongoing record of changes to the legal structure of the company in your statutory books. This includes changes to shareholding, directors, company secretary, registered office, AoA, company name, etc. Also known as the company register or company books, these records must be given to the new owner in the event that you sell your business. Statutory books are usually kept at the company’s registered office and are available for public viewing within office hours. 
 The requirements for statutory books vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but companies are typically required to keep a copy of the Constitution, as well as the certificate they receive from the local authority proving that the business is a properly incorporated legal entity. 
 Shareholders’ Agreement Shareholders’ agreements are not required by law, nor are they publicly accessible, but they can be extremely valuable in ensuring that shareholders are treated fairly, particularly when multiple shareholders are involved. Such agreements can be unanimous or involve only a small group of shareholders, such as the founding team. As new shareholders join the business, they may want to add additional terms to ensure return on their investment; thus shareholders’ agreements tend to become more complex over time. Once a company has hundreds of shareholders or becomes a public company, the need for this document disappears and the applicable  securities regulations  then take over. 
 You can review a template shareholders’ agreement  here . 
 Perhaps the most important part of an agreement like this is a  capitalisation table  that shows who owns how many shares of different types. Shareholders access to financial reports for a company can also be controlled through this agreement. Entrepreneurs should also specify the criteria under which a shareholder can be bought out and how any disagreements should be dealt with. These clauses can have quite a few bells and whistles; such as  shotgun clause , the  right of first refusal , or, most simply, a voluntary sale. 
 Agreements often allow shareholders to  pledge  their shares, issue them to family or give them over to a trust to manage. Each of these possibilities may have tax ramifications which are beyond the scope of this article and should be discussed with a tax professional. Agreements should also set out a procedure to be followed in the event that a member dies. 
 IP Assignment Agreement During incorporation, it is best practice to assign all relevant intellectual property created by the founders to the newly-formed company. This is not a legal requirement, but it is absolutely critical for technology businesses. If your product depends on key IP assets, understanding your right to use such assets will be a central part of any investor’s due diligence. Most investors will not invest in the absence of this document. As such, it is essential to speak to a qualified IP lawyer in the early stages of your company’s life. 
 Employment Agreement As your business expands, it will need to hire employees. In order to provide evidence that an employment relationship exists, it is essential to record these agreements in writing. Failure to do so could have unforeseen consequences at a later stage. 
 Employment contracts set out the obligations that employers and employees have towards each other and the benefits they will receive from mutual association. In particular, they stipulate the material terms of employment, such as how much the employee can expect to get paid and by when. If employees are  entitled to stock or stock options , this should be made clear in their contract. Each agreement must be tailored to suit the individual employment relationship in question. 
 In many instances, the content of employment contracts will be affected by the employment law in your local jurisdiction. For example, it would be illegal to force workers to be in the office for 18 hours per day every day of the week. Employees are entitled to national holidays, as well as a certain amount of paid holiday which may depend on how long they have worked for your company. 
 Another crucial part of an employment agreement is the section on duration. Businesses and employees are legally obliged to give each other a certain amount of notice before the employee is either fired or voluntarily quits. This provides both parties with a degree of financial security. For cases where termination is necessary, the contract will stipulate the grounds on which the owner is able to fire the worker. This might include anything from constant lateness to providing competitors with sensitive information, although many employment agreements allow managers to fire workers at will, without giving a substantive reason. Some businesses lock their senior hires into their operations for months or even years after the end of the contract by including a non-compete clause. 
 Conclusion In summary, the important documents you need to understand as a business owner fall into three broad categories. The Constitution of the company is a legal requirement when you incorporate; you have no choice about whether you draw them up or not. Creating a shareholders’ agreement and IP assignment agreement are not legally mandatory, but highly advisable, particularly if your company plans on acquiring a large number of shareholders or selling globally. As your business develops, you will have to enter into employment contracts with staff. You must also keep your company books up-to-date so that they can be given to a buyer in the event that your business is acquired.

Debugging Recruiting,https://news.greylock.com/debugging-recruiting-9e711654fddb,"Debugging Recruiting

Recruiting great people is a priority for any company at any stage of their growth. In the early stages, finding and hiring your initial team is core to instilling the right company culture. To hire effectively, founders and managers need to be thoughtful and organized about their recruiting process — from the first screening until delivering an offer. A sloppy and inconsistent process reflects poorly on the company, and can be the difference between a “Yes, I want to join” and “No, I don’t think this is the right fit.”



As a Talent Partner at Greylock, I work with our portfolio and advise them on refining their recruiting processes. As such, I’ve become familiar with many of the common problems that both new and experienced teams face when recruiting.



Recently, I gave a talk that addresses some of these frequent “bugs” in the recruiting process, and want to share my presentation here more broadly. I go over the three stages of recruiting — sourcing, evaluation, and conversion — covering common mistakes made at each level as well as the questions you need to answer to avoid them.



The full talk will be available on video and podcast soon, but for now here are the slides from my deck. I hope these thoughts and questions are helpful when thinking about your recruiting process:"

 Definition: Market Entry Market entry  is the bringing in of products or associated products into the target market. While considering market entry, any business will consider the following: Read Next Market  Value Market Capitalization Market Value Added (MVA) Market Market Build-up 
   -          Size of the opportunity 
   -          Barriers to entry 
   -          Industry structure 
   -          Competition 
   -          Projected and historical  growth 
   -          Environment analysis 
   -          Initial investment 
 Sometimes a market entry strategy has to be defined, if there is import/export and a lot of regulations get involved as well. 
 Sometimes, companies consider entering crowded markets, where many factors need to be analysed to differentiate their products, and many times niche markets are created by companies for market entry. 
 Some of the market entry strategies used are as follows: 
 
 Franchising 
 Licensing 
 Alliances 
 Mergers and Acquisitions 
 Exporting 
 Joint ventures 
 
 Market entry strategy also depends on time of market entry. The two models/ strategies generally followed are: 
   -   Waterfall Model:  This model refers to entering different markets at different times, in some sequential order. 
   -   Sprinkler Model:  The sprinkler model aims at entering as many markets as possible, within a limited period of time. 
 Example:  
 Recently Starbucks, the international coffee house giant made an entry into India. For ensuring better and smoother market entry, they formed an alliance with the TATA Group, which helped them in setting up the business more seamlessly in India.   Hence, this concludes the definition of Market Entry along with its overview.

[Pt 2] Selling ‘Jobs to be Done’: Who’s the Customer?,https://medium.com/frameplay/pt-2-selling-jobs-to-be-done-who-s-the-customer-e3a5f80ba527,"[Pt 2] Selling ‘Jobs to be Done’: Who’s the Customer? Sign in Get started Frameplay Jobs to be Done About Frameplay Frameplay - Innovation Consultancy [Pt 2] Selling ‘Jobs to be Done’: Who’s the Customer? Andrea F Hill Follow Nov 29, 2017     ·       3    min read This is a 5 part series on understanding the different flavors of JTBD and how to decide which is most appropriate to help you meet your innovation goals. Background:  Approaches and People Part 1:  What Methodology Should you Hire to Help You Apply “Jobs to be Done”? The Jobs to be Done theory — that “customers want to make progress in their lives and they hire products to help them get that job done” — can revolutionize a company. Rather than focusing on how to compete in a feature war against other competitors based on ‘industry standards’, you have the ability to break away as a result of unique customer insights. But great potential can lead to great confusion. Customer insights can ripple across an organization, and be interpreted differently by different parties. That’s why understanding the context and circumstance that leads to JTBD research is so important. Over the past few weeks, I’ve talked about JTBD with three prospects. Each came to me already thinking JTBD could solve a problem in their business. But each had a different problem to be solved; a different Job to be Done. Each wanted to learn about their customers’ Jobs, but held a different vision of the progress they were trying to make. Change how sales and marketing communicate value to our prospects so we can close more deals faster (Digital Marketing Manager) Improve the product for our customers so they will churn less (UX Director) Cultivate a shared understanding of our customer across the organization so we are more effective in creating and selling products (CEO) Identify adjacent areas where our customers are dissatisfied to introduce new products to our portfolio so we can improve our ARPU and stickiness (Intrapreneur) Not only did each of these customers have a different view of the progress they were trying to make, each one had a different target object he planned to act on. Sales and marketing will change. The product will change. The entire organization will change. Our product portfolio will change. Remember, Jobs to be Done is just a theory about how any why customers and ‘hire’ products into their lives. Even as you learn about and accept the theory, how it’s applied to your organization to meet your specific goals will be unique to you. If you’re part of a team eager to bring Jobs to be Done into your organization, great! You can (hopefully) see how understanding your customers’ progress and struggles can transform your business, and what target objects you have to work with. If you’re a consultant, things may be a little less clear for you. You’re staring down the eye of a powerful weapon, and not sure yet how you want to use it. That’s ok, too. Just be aware that you’re going to be much more successful if you take the time to figure out where you want to shoot it before you pull the trigger with a client :-) Now we have much more information about the customer, his desired progress, and the target object he plans to act on. Soon we can start digging into his struggles and identify a way to move him forward. But first, we need to Define the ‘Job’ in Jobs to be Done [Pt 3]. Learned something?

 Conversations with customers are valuable, but they have to be the right type of conversations – not merely questions about forgotten passwords and the like. They have to add value, for you, and them. 
 Good Conversation, Good Customer 
 In Intercom, we encourage businesses to talk to their customers. It’s how you grow a business; it’s how you keep customers happy, loyal, and evangelical about your product. 
 But talking to your customers isn’t about blindly spitting out messages to everyone, or counting every customer contact as a ‘good thing’. Not all customers – nor all contacts – are of equal importance. Get this wrong, and you’ll drown your team in a wave of valueless communications. 
 Let’s talk about Internet Scale. 
 You can’t talk to everyone about everything 
 
 If you have 1,000,000 monthly active users, and 0.1% contact you each day, you have 1,000 contacts to deal with every day. If each issue takes 10 minutes to solve, that’s 7 full days worth of work generated every day. If your team works in 8 hour shifts, you need a team of 20 staff just to keep up, which means even on modest salaries you’re dropping a few grand a day. You can see how this becomes a problem, right? 
 Eliminating Dumb Contacts 
 
 Most web companies are on the defensive. They fight to beat down their support channels. It’s like a game of Whac-A-Mole, except your mallet doesn’t work. So the idea that you should talk to customers more is often met with derision by lots of businesses.  “But what if they talk back?”  is the common reply. 
 To reduce your volume, you have to reduce your dumb contacts. Every customer communication is either irritating, or valuable, for your company and your customer alike. Dumb contacts are the ones that are irritating for both. 
 For each type of contact, there’s an appropriate action you should follow… 
 
 The next step is simple, quantify each type of dumb contact and how long it takes to resolve. This lets you prioritise your customer service conversations.  
 Prioritising Your Work 
 
 The knee-jerk reaction here is to solve the most frequently occurring issues first. This is often the best way to tackle your volume initially, as it gets rid of the low-hanging fruit. 
 You can’t stop there though. You need to understand which issues take most time. This is usually called average handle time, AHT for short. 
 
 Combining the volume with AHT gives you a sense of where the biggest opportunity is. 
 
 Every category then needs to be thoroughly understood so it can be tackled appropriately. Solving the problem can involve redesign, better copy, faster performances, more robust error handling, broader file support, or plain old bug fixing. 
 Getting on The Front Foot 
 
 As dumb contacts decrease, you have bought yourself capacity to have meaningful interactions with your customers. Ones where you help them get the most from your product, and ones where you learn lots about how it is used, and how it could be improved. These are the communications that grow loyalty and create evangelists. 
 Go ahead, start talking to your customers. If you don’t, your competitor will.

 Ever since the founding of Facebook in February of 2004 and Twitter in March of 2006, marketing has completely changed. Brands that once built campaigns to push market awareness through standardized  marketing channels  are now using social media to drive brand awareness and sales. A prime example is the streetwear industry, which does a great job of using social media to control supply and demand. Instead of focusing on pushing a lot of low-priced items, these brands sell out a limited number of extremely marked-up items, which are fueled by social media hype and promotion. Combining  social media trends  and viral content allows them to leverage the hype and causes the demand to far exceed the quantity available. I absolutely love this business model, which led to me connecting with Elie Neufeld, founder of  DHTK . After identifying streetwear as a major trend in fashion, he launched the brand to merge a variety of major trends, creating one lifestyle brand. By leveraging trends in sports, fashion and other facets of youth lifestyles, DHTK demonstrates the end result of correctly executing on marketing trends. While talking to Neufeld about his growth strategy for DHTK, he shared his gameplan for viral growth, which is universal and can be applied to any industry. Related:  8 Reasons a Powerful Personal Brand Will Make You Successful 1. Identify influential trends on social media. Being active on social media gives you a glimpse at what’s popular in today’s society. In recent years, LeBron James has grown from being one of the top basketball players, into a worldwide cultural icon. Between appearances in blockbuster films, brand alignments and switching from the Cleveland Cavaliers to the Miami Heat and back again, James has become a larger than life on and off the court. DHTK accurately identified sports as a cultural trend with a number of top performers -- LeBron James, Michael Jordan and Stephen Curry all push culture forward with their massive following and influence. Turning to social media can provide you with the insight to clearly  identify the major trends  that people are talking about. 2. Understand and identify the “cool factor.” Many brands and entrepreneurs are able to spot major trends, but simply following them is not enough. You need to be able to understand what the “cool factor” is and leverage it to grow your brand. If you are able to associate your brand with a trending “cool factor,” you ride that wave, drawing attention to your company, which is fueled entirely by that trend. For example, when Drake’s album  If You Are Reading This It Is Too Late  dropped, DHTK combined hip-hop trends, Drake’s growth, unique album design and typeface styles, which resulted in the release of the first  It Is Too Late- inspired designs. It was a success because it combined the unique album design with the company's own brand style. Related:  5 Habits of the Wealthy That Helped Them Get Rich 3. Build social media awareness. Building brand awareness  requires you to identify content that will work with the specific trend you are going after. It doesn’t matter if we are talking about a brand in the fashion, music or sports industry -- each requires a unique style of content the consumer demographic wants to consume. DHTK understands it fits into both sports and fashion, so it creates social media posts that work with both niches. Determine relevant trend niches, identify the prominent hashtags, and spend time determining what content styles your target audience enjoys interacting with. When you do this correctly, the outcome is more engagement and more potential customers discovering your brand. 4. Associate with influencers. Influencer marketing is one of the most promising  trends  -- consumers want to be able to relate to the people they follow on social media. Associating your brand with influencers can result in consumers automatically relating with you, based solely on that relationship with someone they follow on social media. It’s important to make sure an influencer’s brand story aligns perfectly with your brand’s narrative. You do not need to necessarily establish a paid relationship with influencers in order to associate with them. DHTK, which stands for Don’t Hate The King, has clear associations with the common phrase people recite when referencing LeBron James (also known as ""King James"" in basketball circles). This association combines the respect and power of LeBron with the power and aesthetic of the DHTK brand story without any formal partnership. Related:  22 Qualities That Make a Great Leader Final thoughts No matter what industry you are in, leveraging marketing trends can help you boost viral engagement and increase brand awareness and revenue. Pay attention to what people are talking about, then figure out how to do something interesting to get people talking about your brand.

 A year-over-year calculation compares a statistic for one period to the same period the previous year. The period is for a month or quarter basis. The year-over-year growth rate calculates the percentage change during the past twelve months. 
 
   
 
 Year-over-year (YOY) is an effective way of looking at growth for two reasons. ​First, it removes the effects of seasons. For example, say your business revenue rose 20 percent last month. Before you break out the bubbly, check it against the income from the same month last year. Maybe your sales always rise this time of year. If sales typically rise 35 percent this month, then your revenue is down year-over-year. Your business is doing worse, not better.  
 
   
 
 Second, it discerns long-term trends. Say a business is growing at a nice, steady 2 percent a month. But if it grew 3 percent a month last year, it will be down when compared year-over-year. 
 
   
 
 For these reasons, make sure you check what comparisons a financial report is using. Are the authors comparing the data to the previous full year, such as 12 months of accumulated revenue, or to a statistic's value as of the last period of the quarter, month, week, or day? Also, check to see if they are using the calendar year or  fiscal year . 
 
   
 
 If you're thinking about using the YOY statistic, the following snapshot of the pros and cons can help you apply the metric more effectively. 
 
   
 
 
 Pros 
 
 Negates seasonality because it compares specific points in time 
 Smoothes out volatility throughout the year to compare net results 
 Easy to calculate; no need for spreadsheet or financial calculator 
 States results in percentage terms for an easy comparison across different-sized companies 
 
 
 
 Cons 
 
 Offers meaningless results if one time period had negative growth 
 Provides more meaning when trends are observed over several calculated periods 
 Can hide problems in a given month if only comparing full-year metrics YOY 
 Doesn't offer much information unless used with other metrics 
 
 
 
   
      Pros and Cons    
 
 The biggest advantage of year-over-year comparisons is that they automatically negate the effect of seasonality. For example,  retail statistics  rise each November and December because of the holiday shopping season. It's the most critical time of the year as the season accounts for almost 20 percent of retail sales. Another advantage is that the metric is stated in percentage terms, making it easy to compare different-sized companies when doing industry, competitor or peer-company analysis. 
 
   
 
 Year-over-year analysis helps smooth out any volatility in the month-to-month numbers. For example, investors should have used a year-over-year comparison in June 2011. The  Bureau of Labor Statistics reported  that the economy only added 18,000 jobs. They panicked because it was less than the 25,000 jobs added in May and the 217,000 jobs added in April. The  unemployment rate  rose to 9.2 percent. The  stock market  dropped. The prices of safe haven investments like  Treasuries  and  gold  sky-rocketed. Thanks to that panic,  gold hit an all-time high of $1,895 an ounce  a few months later. 
 
   
 
 In this case, the calculation seemed misleading when using individual months YOY, but when using full-year results, the calculation showed that the total number of  employed  people had increased by 1.8 million between June 2010 and June 2011. The economy’s recovery had not derailed. There are more examples like these in the  current jobs report  and the  current unemployment report. 
 
   
 
 
 Don’t rely on year-over-year alone. It's a good idea to look at month-to-month as well to get the full picture.   
 
 
 A few issues can arise with the YOY calculation, especially if a company experiences a period of negative growth. The resulting growth rate won't make sense. Also, as with many other business metrics, the YOY statistic provides much more information when calculated for a few time periods to reveal trends, and doesn't really explain enough of a company's growth story unless used along with other metrics. 
 
   
 
 If you rely only on the YOY metric, calculated with full-year values, you may also miss problems such as abnormally low growth in one month, which gets smoothed out if using a full-year number for the calculation. 
 
   
 
 Most business news reports monthly trends. You usually have to seek out the year-over-year number yourself, but you can find the formula inputs on a company's financial statements and easily calculate the statistic with a standard calculator. 
 
   
      How to Calculate the Year-Over-Year Growth Rate

 To calculate the year-over-year growth rate, you need two numbers and a calculator. Then take these three steps. 
 
   
 
 Subtract last year's number from this year's number. That gives you the total difference for the year. If it's positive, it indicates a year-over-year gain, not a loss. For example, this year you sold 115 paintings. Last year you sold 110. You sold 5 more paintings this year. Then, divide the difference by last year's number. That's 5 paintings divided by 110 paintings. That gives you the year-over-year growth rate.  Now simply put it into percent format. You find 5 / 110 = 0.045 or 4.5 percent. 
 
   
 
 Let’s return to the employment example. In June 2011, total employment was 131.017 million. Total employment in June 2010 was 130.021 million. Here's how to calculate the year-over-year growth rate. 
 
   
 
 Subtract 130.021 million from 131.017 million. The difference is 0.996 million or 996,000. Divide 0.996 million by 130.021 million, last year's employment number. The answer is 0.00766 or 0.766 percent. That's the year-over-year growth rate. 
 
   
      Examples    
 
 Most government statistics are month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter. You'll need to calculate the year-over-year numbers yourself to get the full picture. Here are three  leading economic indicators  where it's important to do year-over-year calculations: 
 
   
 
 Durable Goods : The  Commerce Department  reports this statistic month-to-month. But YOY calculations warned of the  Great Recession  as early as October 2006. Manufacturing Jobs : America had been losing  manufacturing  jobs on a monthly basis for years. But when jobs started declining YOY in 2007, it was a sign of the pending  recession . Gross Domestic Product : It says how fast the  economy grew  in the most recent quarter. The  Bureau of Economic Analysis  annualizes the  GDP growth rate . It reports how much the economy would produce for the entire year if it continued growing at the same rate. The BEA does that so it’s easier for you to do a YOY comparison with previous years of GDP growth.

Get to know your user: personas & jobs to be done.,https://blog.prototypr.io/30dayuxchallenge-day-5-get-to-know-your-user-personas-jobs-to-be-done-d0c272ffed58,"Get to know your user: personas & jobs to be done. - Prototypr Sign in Get started UX Design 101 The Interaction Review en español 🇪🇸 Prototyping Tools  Get to know your user: personas & jobs to be done. #30dayUXchallenge [Day 5] UX Boot Camp Follow Nov 5, 2017     ·       5    min read Personas template On  day 3 , we talked about how Design Thinking can help our team in keeping the user at the center of the conversation and how Empathy Maps are a great way to start consolidating the team’s knowledge about the users. We all know that really understanding our users is fundamental to UX design. So today we will cover how  Personas  and  Jobs to be done  complement each other and are ~actually~ useful :P Personas Personas are one of the best ways to empathize with our users. Giving them a name, a face and knowing details about their life helps you and the team to connect and design for them. do. Summing it up: A photo or illustration that visually represents that persona A quote, that best summarizes their motivation/relationship with your product Demographics: age, family status & occupation (because it ties to their motivations) Their feelings: main point points & frustrations, motivations and goals (also somehow related to your product) Context: when and how they would be using your product. Persona template Together, these data-points should summarize “who” that group of user represents, “why” they use the product and “how” they are using it. However, working with personas as the main resource to deeply understand our user’s motivation has proven more and more challenging over time, mainly because personas often overlap each other or have multiple motivations. It’s confusing, I know. That’s why Jobs to be done are becoming another popular resource. Jobs to be done If you are not familiar with the concept, ‘Jobs to be done’ is used to focus on the key high-level tasks the user wants to achieve when using our product(s). By understanding what is the overarching goals we can focus on creating the best user experience for this. It aligns the team to solve the most important tasks. For example, Marktplaats works on Customer Journey teams, and Rochelle works on the ‘Placing Journey Team’, which is the end to end experience from creating an advertisement online, managing ads to removing. This is a simplified version of what a Job to be Done on Marktplaats placing team could be:  “As an occasional seller, I need a way to create a successful ad so that I can sell my product as quick as possible”. As you can see in this, the team identified the persona which is an occasional seller. They want to create a successful ad, and we know their motivation is to sell as fast as possible, maybe they are moving house. We can use this high-level Job to be done to guide us in everything we do in the project. How can we help them to create a successful ad? How can we help them to sell fast? At Marketplaats, Jobs to be done are phrased in the way of : And, the same user (aka, the same persona), could be using our product for different reasons, in different situations. But yes, it is still the same persona. Another brief example would be: At Envato, users can purchase digital assets that help them with their own projects. The assets could be CMS themes, After Effects templates or even an illustration. Let’s use as an example a user that is a freelancer developer, and often purchases templates for his clients: he would be a frequent buyer and he would probably have specific budget and requirements for his client’s projects. But then let’s assume he decides to work on a side project and he is creating a website to talk about a personal hobby. So our same “freelancer developer persona” hires us for two different jobs. In this context, if we ask: What job is the freelancer developer trying to get done?, we could get two different conclusions: “ delivering my client’s projects in time”  and the secondary one being  “Creating a website for my hobby”. Both jobs above will have different needs, different deadlines and specific budgets. And why is it important for us to understand both? Because these insights will actually help us understanding, in more detail than the persona sheets,  why  that user is cultivating a relationship with our product and  what  they are using it for. After defining the main jobs to be done, some teams also break it down by “functional” and “emotional” criteria — that way you can understand what is the user’s rationale behind that purchase, but also what is their emotional motivations to engage with our product/service. Jobs to be done template The findings above are just useful if the team is aware of them and use it as their north-star. Make sure it’s well shared, repeated and used! :) Ps.: Day 12 will be covering “creative ways to playback research findings to your team”. So hang in there — we will come back to this topic pretty soon! What about you? What are your means to keep the user at the center of the conversation?

 Do NOT raise VC funding â The 3 main reasons against it. 
 
 October 14th 2019 
 
  Tweet This 
 
 
 
 By  Thomas Hawk . We  all follow the tech news closely. At the time of writing this post,  Techcrunch’s  front page has 6 stories about startups raising VC funding, 1 story about a later stage company starting to invest in startups, and 1 story about a VC firm having raised a new fund. The headlines about money are mixed with a couple of articles around recent developments for well-known companies, a smartphone review and (ironically) a story around a recent partner promotion at a VC firm. It’s clear that the combination of startups + $ generates interest within our community. 🤑 And a lot of the time, as a small unknown startup, getting VC funding is one of the few tactics around to gain some journalistic interest for your business. Since a lot of the startup media bandwidth is dedicated to financing, amongst entrepreneurs there also seems to be an over-indexed belief that the path to success = venture funding. This. Is. Not. The. Case. Most companies should never ever consider raising capital. Here are my 3 top reasons why you should NOT raise VC funding. 1. Entrepreneurial success takes many forms Success can be articulated in many ways. Most often it has to do with a sense of accomplishment, living according to your values, and freedom to pursue a life where you control your destiny. Very rarely is it defined by financial outcome. Such is very much the case with entrepreneurship. Surely, if you founded Uber you would feel an amazing pride in having created a company with a global footprint which impacts people all over the world, and the financial upside is insane. However, a tiny  satoshi  of all companies ever make it into becoming 100 MUSD value range, not even considering the multi BUSD stratosphere. But as an entrepreneur, you may just as well feel endless success and satisfaction by creating the professional freedom gained from having a 3-person team profitably delivering a product or service to a small part of the world. If that lean team also manages the business efficiently you may be able to collect annual dividends and live a financially comfortable life. When you bootstrap or organically grow a company you have all the options in the world. You decide the speed, professional lifestyle, and how to reinvest or pocket any excess profits generated. But at the time a company raises VC funding you suddenly limit your company’s path into something where success is defined by large value creation. Expectations of rapid growth will overshadow most other things. In some cases you may also give up a bunch of control and freedom to your investors who suddenly can make a decision which goes against you around the strategic direction of the company and even your own job and function within the organization. Understand your own drivers behind your entrepreneurial ambition and why you are choosing to create a new company, and recognize there are other paths and rewards to entrepreneurial success than raising VC funding. 2. Your market is simply not big enough If you’re willing to give up control to pursue your opportunity, and you believe external capital will get you there faster, in order to be a likely candidate for VC funding you need to make sure your market (and ambition) is big enough. VCs invest with the potential of outside returns from companies who are true outliers when it comes to value creation. Fund economics is based upon  power law distribution , where often one single company in a whole portfolio represents the vast amount of returns generated. The difficult thing for a VC is that it’s hard to know and predict which one that will be at the time of investing. Hence, most VCs invests on the basis that every single investment must have a theoretical likelihood of becoming a huge outlier. The analysis done on how large a company could become (i.e. how much it can be valued at) is therefore often anchored in the underlying market opportunity. This comes down to answering basic questions like how many people or companies suffer from the problem the startup is trying to solve, and how much is the willingness to pay for such a solution. Unless the underlying market is multi-BUSD it’s unlikely VCs would invest in you. Keep in mind that often times  your market is also smaller than you think it is . To put this into perspective, at  Creandum  when I’m analyzing market opportunities, at a minimum I would like a single company to have a theoretical chance of returning a quarter of our fund. For a VC with a $200M fund, our investment would need to generate $50M proceeds for us. For simplicity of math, say the fund owns 10% at the time of exit, the company need to exit at a $500M valuation. This is the floor of the opportunity and most of the time we aspire to look for companies who pursue an opportunity sized far north from that. The reality is that most companies are not going after large enough markets to generate this kind of value creation. We fairly quickly rule out companies which are pursuing a local, whether it’s a Swedish, or Nordic, or even European version of a well-known company category. Even if you do everything correct and win the market, a Swedish Netflix will not create enough value to generate the above returns. Do the math, and in case you are not pursuing a large enough opportunity don’t pursue raising venture capital from institutional funds. There can still be local angels and alternative sources of financing which can be useful, if you really need money, but the VCs you read about on Techcrunch will shy away from you unless you can show a truly sizable upside potential. 3. You’re the superstar. Not the VC. The VC industry is amazing at marketing. The story which is portrayed over and over is that from us you get “smart money”. Together with cash to invest into building out your company we also bring valuable advice, connections, and sometimes functional expert resources in areas like growth marketing, recruiting, sales development, etc. VCs are superheroes who have proprietary skills and resources entrepreneurs desperately need. But let’s set the record straight. VCs will not make your business a success. And  VCs oversell their value-add to entrepreneurs . In reality what VCs provide in ranking order is: Cash: The abilities for you (not the VC) to access financial resources which you can spend wisely in order to make your company grow faster and stronger. Quality validation: By securing VC funding you have had an independent professional investor evaluating your company’s product, team, and market and deemed it attractive enough to back. This third party validation creates a halo effect which will help you (not the VC) to easier hire talent, land customers, and (as we know from the intro of this article) get press coverage. Advice/connections/resources: Any good VC will surely give you valuable advice where they can reflect on previous experiences from companies overcoming similar challenges as you’re facing. And they may even have a network through which you eventually land a key client and/or hire. I’d like to think that me and my colleagues, in fact, do provide this to the companies we work with. This is all great but… …the ultimate outcome of the company weighs on your shoulders and your abilities (not the VC’s). Successful companies are made because the entrepreneur is fantastic — not the VC. Successful companies are made because of amazing execution by the people who are deep in the trenches. Successful companies are made by entrepreneurs making the right micro-decisions every day, every hour, every minute. Strategic advice is easy. Execution is hard. So don’t feel you need a VC in order to be successful. You are the superstar! Own it! Final words The only path of entrepreneurship is not what you read about on Techcrunch. Building your company independent gives you unlimited options. Don’t rush into the path of VC funding too soon, if you treasure your entrepreneurial freedom. And if you choose to still raise capital, make sure the opportunity is massive and have realistic expectations of what your investors can do for you. If you fit this script, feel free to  reach out to me ! 💪 👊

 Creative Ways To Identify New Market Segments    .entry-header  
 
 Regardless of your company size it’s important to constantly evaluate your market segments in relation to your competitors. 
 Identifying segments that either your competitors have missed or are untapped opportunities for you is challenging and requires a wholistic approach that uses both right-brain and left-brain thinking. 
 To do this, it’s best to gather a team of employees who work in different departments with different expertise and conduct a few exercises. Below are three team exercises that might help your business identify new market segments. 
 Mind Map 
 Get your team to think of the various uses of your product and write them down on a white board. Once they come up with an initial list, branch out into even more specific uses and brainstorm every possible scenario one could use your product, even if it seems absurd. Remind everyone that they aren’t looking for viable segments at this point, just fun ideas. 
 If you keep doing this and further soliciting ideas, you will eventually come up with some niche segments. Now it’s just a matter of  conducting research  to see if those segments are A) already customers of your competitors and B) part of an available market. An available market simply means that you can realistically compete to get those customers. Do you have the right resources, expertise and location to go after that segment? If not, scrap that segment and move onto the next. 
 Value Proposition Analysis 
 Determine who your competitor’s customers are and create customer profiles according to demographic, geographic, psychographic and behavioral characteristics. Then write down your competitor’s value proposition according to cost, service and technology. Now look at your value proposition according to the same categories. Does either company’s value proposition address the needs of the niche segments identified in the Mind Map exercise? If not, you have a viable segment to target. 
 Big Wig Matching 
 Get everyone to shout out big brands that are familiar to everyone. Brainstorm words and attributes associated with each brand. Now get the team to say which brand they feel is closely associated with your company, products and services and then do the same for your competitors. Are you positioned where you’d like to be? Or are your competitors associated with brands that you want to be associated with? If so, do an  analysis of their customers  and target those segments in your campaigns.

What is the Product-Market Fit and How to Measure It,https://uxplanet.org/what-is-the-product-market-fit-and-how-to-measure-it-b5bb3db07dae,"What is the Product-Market Fit and How to Measure It Sign in Get started UX Planet User Experience UX for Beginners User Research Career Publish on UX Planet Español Arabic What is the Product-Market Fit and How to Measure It inapptics Follow Jan 11, 2018     ·       4    min read If you are here reading this, then you might be struggling to understand whether your startup is on the right path or not. Your understanding of product market fit can give you a lot of useful answers. But the hardest part here is that few people have any idea of this and few people can provide you with specific metrics to measure product-market fit. So, in this article, I will try to give you at least some insights into product-market fit. Let’s get started with the definition. While a lot of people have come with definitions of product market fit, the most cited one by far is Marc Andreessen’s definition: “Product market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market.” Sounds too broad, right? This definition along with the term itself was coined back in 2007. And although it might have some blank spaces in between, it is still being circulated as one of the best definitions of product market fit. But what is “a good market?” Isn’t this something a bit vague? Markets can be different and categorizing them as roughly good or bad might not be the best strategy so far. Andrew Chen has an interesting  article  on this topic. He also discusses what a market is and how to know if it’s real. In fact, according to Chen, there are three things that are characteristic of a great market: a large number of potential users high growth in the number of potential users ease of user acquisition Accordingly, you can always feel when product market fit is present and when it is not. Let’s discuss the two scenarios one by one. Scenario #1 Your customers aren’t getting a lot of value out of your product. They do not tell their friends/family members about it: word of mouth advertising does not work. What is worse, customer reviews do not seem very positive. The usage of your product is not growing, and the sales cycle takes way longer than at the beginning. In addition, a whole lot of deals never close. Conclusion If this is the case, then most probably, product market fit is not present. Scenario #2 Your customers are buying your product/new features as fast as they can. The usage is growing rapidly. You are hiring sales and support staff as fast as you can. Customer reviews are all or mainly positive. Reporters are knocking on all your doors and windows to get an interview with you. Your customers/users are real brand ambassadors for you. They are selling the product for you through word of mouth. Conclusion If this is the case, then most probably, product market fit is present. How can you measure product market fit? There are a few tactics you can use to see whether you have reached PMF or not. More concretely, if you want to reach product-market fit, you need to set proper goals. So, below are a few metrics that help understand your progress and see how near you are to the completion of your goal. Net Promoter Score Image source By this, you will be measuring how likely your users are to recommend your product to a friend. This test is all about measuring how much people love your product. The more they love it, the more prone to sharing it they will be. Constant engagement Engagement is the  metric  that shows how much a user interacts with your product in a given timeframe. If a certain amount of new users starts using your product, and then they never stop, then you have nailed the engagement. Paying users Is a significant amount of your users paying money to buy your product or a feature of your product? If you are solving a big problem for them, then they are sure to pay you money. In addition, if you do not solve a big problem well enough, you won’t be paid. Note that this “well enough” does not only relate to great design. Take Reddit, it has an awful design, but it does solve the problem of knowledge sharing for its users. Organic user base Do you get your users through lots of paid ads and sales efforts or you get them through word of mouth? If your existing users are so happy with your product as to tell everyone else about it, then organic growth is ensured. Fin Now you have at least some idea on how to reach product-market fit. No one said it will be an easy journey. But it’s definitely worth a try! Found this post useful?

 Did you know that  only  44% of B2B content marketers  know what successful or effective content marketing looks like? 
 Let that sink in. 
 That means that 56% of content marketers are aimlessly creating content without any direction or end goal. This content is not generating traffic, leads, or sales. 
 So what does proper or effective content marketing look like? 
 For businesses that rely on quality leads, effective content marketing is a massive opportunity for growth. The right strategies and tactics can have your content working overtime for you. 
 That's why I'd like to share with you 3 of the primary ways industry-leading brands use content to drive lead generation. 
 Content Lead Generation Tip #1: Source-specific landing pages and CTAs 
 Content is as much about  promotion and distribution  as it is creation. So while you're busy getting your content out into the world, you'll be receiving traffic from many different sources. 
 Outbound activities, like  content syndication  and guest posting on websites with large audiences, are a big opportunity for site personalization. 
 According to  CrazyEgg , landing pages with personalized content convert more than four times better than ones without. 
 Take a look below at how Groove greets their visitors with source specific messages and content. For a guest post on Copyblogger, Groove set up a landing page filled with targeted content for Copyblogger readers.  It includes popular blog posts, testimonials, and a personalized message from Groove CEO Alex Turnbull at the bottom PLUS an exclusive offer only for Copyblogger readers. 
 It's one powerful example of how you can combine your content with source-specific tactics and drive lead generation.  
 A  landing page building tool  can help you get landing pages built and published quickly for all of the specific traffic being sent back to your website. It's an easy way to add personalization and audiences appreciate it (and are more likely to convert as a result). 
 
 
 Content Lead Generation Tip #2: Content upgrades 
 Content upgrades are bonuses attached to a piece of content to incentivize lead generation. 
 In exchange for lead information, readers could receive… 
 
 Bonus ideas or tactics 
 A downloadable infographic 
 A worksheet or checklist 
 A downloadable PDF for offline reading 
 An audio readout of your blog article 
 A free starter template 
 
 Supplementing your content with content upgrades ranks high as an effective lead generation tactic by many marketing pros. The great thing about content upgrades is that they're flexible and can be applied to almost any type of content. 
 Brian Dean  of Backlink o is a big believer in content upgrades and is sure to include them in all of his blog posts. 
 In the example below, he includes an encapsulated call-to-action after the intro and lets his readers know that this post is 3,142 words long and can be downloaded in PDF format for easy reading.  
 
 Create a list of content upgrade ideas that you could insert into every blog post. Even something as simple as a PDF download can contribute to your lead generation efforts. 
 Content Lead Generation Tip #3: Inline CTAs 
 Continuing on with the theme of targeting your audience with content to generate leads, inline calls-to-action consistently rank as one of the most effective conversion tactics. 
 Why inline CTAs? 
 Inline CTAs convert much better than others because they directly relate to the content at hand. They're placed within a piece of content so as to mesh naturally with whatever topic you're touching on. 
 A blog post on ""10 Instagram Best Practices"", for example, could include a mention of your new eBook called ""Instagram Images Done Right."" After being primed with excellent Instagram tips, your reader is more likely to convert on an eBook that is related to the topic they've just read. 
 In the example blog post from  EnchantingMarketing  below, the author is elaborating on the most effective copywriting formulas. 
 After detailing a few of the formulas the author makes sure to insert a CTA for her book ""How to Write Seductive Web Copy"" for the reader to convert on. If the reader has read most of the post already and arrived here, they'd be much more eager to learn more writing skills. 
 
 Look for ways to insert relatable offers/content upgrades into your content for an instant spike in conversions. Remember that the more it relates to the content you're producing the more impact it will have. 
 Wrapping up 
 If you're one of the 56% of marketers out there aimlessly creating content without goals or measurable metrics, you  need  to stop and reassess your strategy. 
 The right content strategies, approached in the correct way, can effectively drive lead generation. 
 To recap these top three ways leading brands use content to drive lead generation, they were: 
 
 Source specific landing pages 
 Content upgrades 
 Inline CTAs

 You’ve decided to start a business but believe that you’d be (much) better off with co-founders. Not a bad idea, of course. How do you pick the right person? This decision may be the most important of your company’s entire history. Most early-stage startups fail due to founder disputes, not the substance of the business. And founders spend so much time together that the business relationship is the closest some of them will ever get to marriage. This is a high-octane, high-consequence, long-term date. 
 Here are the most important things to look for in your entrepreneurial other half. 
 1. A complementary temperament.   If you tend to run a little hot in a tense moment, get yourself a Cool Hand Luke. If you’re the staid type, the ideal partner is likely someone more charismatic. The point is not that oil should seek water or that opposites must attract. The point is instead to find someone who will fill in the gaps around your personality strengths so that employees, partners, and investors will see and benefit from the balance. You’ll discover that different people will cotton to each of you, and that pattern will have more to do with the third parties’ personalities than anything else. Diversity on your founding team will give you strength. 
 2. Different operational skills.   If you’re a product guru, maybe you need a business development or sales-oriented leader to get your vision to market. If you are great at the finances, an early-stage Excel ninja partner probably isn’t be the top priority. Even within a discipline there are differences in core operational strengths: often highly technical businesses will have more than one highly technical co-founder, but one of them will, for example, be a terrific architect while the other will be excellent at R&D or engineering. A common tactical error here is for a product- or technology-focused entrepreneur to look for someone with top shelf management consulting experience: it’s not a bad instinct, since management consultants are polished and smart, but they rarely have core executive chops apart from project management or some general “operations” background. 
 3. Similar work habits.  You should find someone who shares your expectations on work-life balance. Mismatches on hours or effort quickly and reliably lead to resentments. You don’t need to be in the office at exactly the same times, unless for some reason your business actually requires it (as, for example, in a securities trading house). But you do need to share a view as to how much you will work. 
 4. Self-sufficiency.  Your co-founder isn’t like any other colleague or employee. She must be fully reliable and self-sufficient, someone who functions on auto-pilot with virtually no input from you. Of course, this is the ideal description of any person at your company. But for a co-founder this is an absolute requirement. 
 5. A history of working together.   If possible, it’s best to work with someone you’ve known for a while or with whom you’ve collaborated before. Easy familiarity helps conversations move quickly and allows trustworthy cooperation. This does not mean you need to work with your best friend of many years. Doing so presents its own risks. But a long-term relationship can help you leapfrog the learning curve of the close collaboration, which can sometimes take years to develop. That means that selecting a business school section-mate as your partner just because you’re currently in your second MBA year together is an extremely bad idea. There’s an important caveat here: in a co-founding relationship, you don’t really know the other person till the worm turns. That means you won’t see the full color of your partner until something in the business or one of your personal lives goes (very) badly. If you haven’t been through the crucible together before, be prepared for what she may be like when you do. 
 6. Emotional buoyancy.   Things always get tough at one stage or another in a startup or small company. There are bad days, bad moments, bad deals, bad quarters, etc. Even if you’re a passionate and relentless person, now and again you’ll have a tough, “down” day. It’s excellent if the things that make you feel low aren’t the same as those that get to your partner. As a founder, you can’t always show your colleagues when you’re having a tough day, but you should be able to show your co-founder, and she should be able to buoy you when needed. Ideally, you’ll be there for her when she needs it, because whatever is making her down won’t faze you as much. 
 7. Total honesty.   You and your partner must be committed to telling each other the truth all the time, even if it’s tough to say or hear. This requires practice and emotional investment. You can’t pick a partner who is afraid to tell you what you need to hear. 
 8. Comfort in her own skin.  Insecurity and ego, like fear, can kill your partnership. The best co-founders are those who know themselves well and are comfortable in their own skins. This will save you from having (too frequent) difficult arguments about roles and responsibilities. 
 9. A personality you like.   I’m surprised at how often this one gets missed. At the end of the day, if you don’t like your partner, all the other great qualities she possesses won’t be enough to sustain you through the long haul of building a business. You’re going to spend a lot of time with each other, probably more than you do with your spouses. 
 10. The same overall vision.  Your co-founder should buy into the central vision for the business you are starting. Even after all the many other pieces of the puzzle come together, it is essential that your partner’s main motivations for joining your venture include a passion for the project you are pursuing. There are so many reasons a small business or startup won’t succeed. A mismatch between the founders’ visions should not be one.

Jeremy Liew Follow Nov 28, 2017     ·       2    min read I love having fun. So do you. None of us have enough delight in our lives. When we find it, we want to evangelize it. We want to spread the joy around. This leads to word-of-mouth viral growth. Snapchat*, from the beginning, is deliberately fun, not functional. We use iMessage to tell someone you’re running late but we use Snapchat to send someone a funny selfie that will make them smile. Instagram from its infancy is all about delivering joy through beautiful images. It’s a highlight reel and the filters are designed to make everything look perfect. Musical.ly was originally an education social network before the founders realized that lipsynching is  much more fun than instructional videos.  It grew through word of mouth too. SoulCycle transformed indoor cycling from a grind into a dance party on a bike. Their devotees love sharing, posting and talking  about all things SoulCycle. The growth of HQ Trivia* has been similarly explosive. via Amit Shafarir People play together, in person and remotely, because playing is fun. They are adding the game times to their calendar and inviting their friends because they want to share the excitement.

 Why working as an account manager is no easy task 
 An account manager focuses on maintaining the agency-client relationship by working with the client to develop a business strategy that will fulfill their needs. Everybody wants something from them -- now. Some account managers are analytical geniuses. Others are charming extroverts. Regardless of style, there are effective skills account managers should possess. The most effective account managers possess a wide variety of skills.

 According to the  Marketing Agency Growth Report 2018 , 12% of agencies feel one of their greatest struggles is retaining employees. One reason for a high turnover rate is lack of faith in management. Here are six key strengths we believe every effective account manager should have: 
 
 6 Key Strengths of an Account Manager 
 
 Recognizes their Constituencies 
 Communicates Well 
 Sees the Forest from the Trees 
 Gets Their Hands Dirty 
 Avoids A Cookie Cutter Approach 
 Earns Respect 
 
 
 1) Recognizes all their constituencies 
 Serving clients is important. Critical. But the top-notch account managers get that clients are merely one of their constituencies. First among equals perhaps, but still only one group of stakeholders. Account managers also have to meet the expectations of the agency's senior management. Then of course, there are the agency's team members -- those folks we call the ""revenue generators."" 
 That's a lot of people, expectations, and needs for an account manager to balance, which is why we list this trait first. Effective account managers apply every other trait listed here on  all  the communities they serve. 
 Why this matters:  Think of clients, senior management, and team members as legs of a stool. If any single leg is getting short shrift, the entire enterprise is thrown off balance. 
 2) Communicates well 
 Communication is sharing and listening. Top notch account managers constantly and consistently share the important information, whether that's campaign updates to clients, client insights to team members to use in campaigns, or the state of account health to senior management. 
 They also listen  more than they talk . They ask questions to learn what's really going on. And they don't just wait for someone to decide to talk to them. Account managers are genuinely concerned with everyone's success. They pro-actively dig into issues and get people to share with them. 
 Why this matters:  No one likes surprises. Constant communication means expectations, priorities, and goals are clear to everyone. 
 3) Sees the Forest from the Trees 
 Effective account managers hold a breadth of meaningful information, regarding both the big picture and the minutiae. They understand all their clients' different marketing and business goals. They also know where teams are in executing those campaigns and how campaigns are performing, down to key metrics. They can quantify the value their agency is providing the client, as well as the  value of the client to the agency . 
 Even if the account manager can't hold each data point in her head -- she knows where to find it quickly. 
 Why this matters:  Knowledge is power. Productive, persuasive account managers identify leading metrics to head off challenges before they become problems. They can share successes in real time. Knowing in detail what's going on really helps with the whole communicating well thing. 
 4) Gets their hands dirty 
 The best account managers didn't just jump into the client and project management side of agency work. They spent years on the front lines, creating and executing marketing campaigns. They have a track record that gives them credibility and perspective. 
 They ""keep"" their hands dirty by staying current in marketing trends and their clients' industries. They get into the trenches with team members to understand how they're working and where their challenges are. 
 Why this matters:  Account managers can't speak with authority without first having earned trust and confidence. Any account manager who wants to be taken seriously can't helicopter in and out. 
 5) Avoids a cookie-cutter approach 
 Because the effective account managers have deep knowledge and experience, they don't retread the same campaigns for every client. They take the time to learn about each client individually, their industry, the pain points, personas, messages, and goals. They  lead, rather than manage , their clients.  
 And since they work to maintain their level of expertise in the constantly changing world of marketing, they're well positioned to get creative so their clients stand out in a crowded field. 
 Why this matters:  Because your agency has to stand out as well. A creative account manager validates your agency as a source of expertise that isn't restricted to re-running the same campaigns each quarter. 
 6) Earns Respect 
 Respect is the foundation of a good relationship. Account managers who can move people to action first take the time to get know them in an authentic and personal way. 
 An account manager who builds strong, genuine relationships with people can protect a team from getting committed beyond capacity. He understands the internal concerns and motivations of different people on the client side. 
 Why this matters:  When an account manager has rapport and trust, he has more influence with teams and clients. This can translate into anything from keeping the client happy with a realistic production schedule to securing needed resources for the team. 
 Effective Account Managers Grow Accounts 
 These traits are especially valuable because they do more than help an account manager successfully manage the day to day. 
 When combined, these account managers are valued partners who see the opportunities where your agency can provide more value to clients. In turn, they are able to then coax more budget from clients to expand the exisiting relationships. 
 Clients want partners. The most effective account managers make sure clients know they've got one in your agency.

When done right, lean startup methodology is a great model for building yourÂ business. June 12th, 2017 Â Â Â | Â Â Â By:  Emma McGowan Â Â Â  | Â Â Â Tags:  Lean If youâre involved in the startup world, youâve probably heard the term âlean startupâ thrown around. No, itâs not a new weight loss plan â although I wouldnât doubt that there are health and fitness apps out there who have used lean startup methodology. 
 Itâs a system for creating a business that was first introduced by entrepreneur Eric Ries in 2008 and then outlined in his 2011 book  The Lean Startup: How Todayâs Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Business . 
 In our article  19 Startup Books Every Founder ShouldÂ Read , Lauren Foundos, Founder & CEO,Â  FORTÃ  said the following: 
 
 âThe Lean StartupÂ is an incredible book because it recounts the experience of Eric Ries. He highlights his mistakes in an effort to help you avoid making the same mistakes. He discusses the importance of understanding your target audience, creating an MVP, focusing on actionable metrics, and knowing when to adapt and iterate without wasting too much time. All of his advice is extremely valuable, and helpful in order to avoid common founder mistakes.â 
 
 For the entire lean startup methodology and philosophy, you should definitely go read that book. Seriously â it will change your approach to business. 
 But for a quick overview â maybe just to pique your interest and see if this is a model youâre interested in â keep reading. 
 Where Did âLean Startupâ Come From? 
 
 It started with risk. 
 Risk is the characteristic that distinguishes a startup from any other type of business. Imagine the experience of quitting a stable, secure job to venture into the unknown. Itâs terrifying, and if youâre reading this blog post, you know how terrifying this experience is âÂ because youâve probably done it. 
 Thatâs  why Eric Ries wroteÂ The Lean Startup Â â to help companies navigate and minimize these risks through minimum viable products (MVPâs), rigorous experimentation, and a commitment to learning. 
 At its core, adhering to the lean startup methodology is all about creating a sustainable business with minimal waste of both time and money. 
 This concept grew out of two things: 
 
 Two failed businesses in Riesâ own portfolio and, 
 The streamlined process of creating cars that was developed in Japan after World War II. 
 
 In the case of Riesâ failures, he saw that heâd spent a lot of time and money building products, without ever confirming that those products were solving a real problem. Guess what happened? 
 You got it â they flopped. 
 In the Japanese model of building cars, which involves reducing and eliminating waste in order to get the end product to the customer at the lowest cost for highest value, Riesâ saw a system that could be applied to entrepreneurship. 
 As Eric puts it, âwe have to change our notion of what a modern company looks like.â Disruptive innovation comes from cross-functional teams, comfort with failure, and a rigorous commitment to learning. Every company, large or small, can become a startup. Entrepreneurship is a crucial function for almost any type of organization. 
 Lean Startup Methodology: 
Build â Measure â Learn 
 
 Entrepreneurs that practice the lean startup methodology are encouraged to question everything â from their initial idea, to their design choices, to any features theyâre considering adding. 
 In following this process, entrepreneurs discover their minimal viable product (MVP), which Ries encourages to release to a select group of test customers to determine what improvements need to be made. 
 A good example of an MVPÂ that fits within lean startup philosophy is a  âsmoke test site,â  which can be used toÂ  validate interest in your product or service  while offering a low barrier to entry. 
 A smoke test site is one that is just a facade. It looks like itâs a real service, but itâs really just a flat site with no back-end, nothing built out, and no real actions.Â They can be used easily to track and estimate demand for your business idea, and to help gather contact information for people who may be interested.Â The point of this site is to see if anyone tries to buy. 
 While the MVP is often extremely minimalistic, the feedback from the initial group of test customers helps entrepreneurs learn whatâs working, understand what isnât, and figure out what direction they should go. 
 The general idea is that startup founders should follow the model â which Riesâ has named  âbuild-measure-learnâ  â repeatedly, with the goal of turning that MVP into a sustainable business. Oftentimes, that feedback leads founders to pivot from one idea, market, or niche to another in their quest for a great product. 
 Innovation is a high risk sport on an idea by idea basis, but you can dramatically increase the quality and reliability of your outcomes in the way you manage new concepts. 
 Creating structured ideas and then figuring out creative ways to test them is central to the lean startup movement, not to mention the scientific method itself. And it turns out itâs a  great way to innovative , even if youâre short on resources. 
 Build-measure-learn is a research-intensive process that can be emotionally fraught, as creators have to be willing to not only put their creations out into the world before theyâre âfinishedâ but also take feedback and implement it. 
 However, if done properly, the lean startup methodology  can lead to a company that serves its clientâs needs, is sustainable, and is verified before the founder even starts looking for funding . Riesâ website cites Dropbox as a prime example of a big company that used his methodology to get where they are today. 
 Why âBuild â Measure â Learnâ Isnât Just Throwing Things Against the Wall to See If TheyÂ Work 
 The  goal of Build-Measure-Learn  is not to build a final product to ship or even to build a prototype of a product,Â but to maximize learning through incremental and iterative engineering.Â (Learning could be about product features, customer needs, the right pricing and distribution channel, etc.) The âbuildâ step refers to building a minimal viable product (an MVP.) Itâs critical to understand thatÂ an MVP is not the product with fewer features. Rather it is the simplest thing that you can show to customersÂ to getÂ the most learning at that point in time. 
 This five-part version of the Build-Measure-LearnÂ diagram helps us see that the real intent of building is to test âideasâ â not just to build blindly without an objective. 
 
 The circle labeled âcodeâ could easily be labeled âbuild hardwareâ or âbuild artificial genome.â The circle labeled âdataâ indicates that after we measure our experiments weâll use the data to further refine our learning. And the new learning will influence our next ideas. So we can see that the goal of Build-Measure-Learn isnât just to build things, the goal is to build things to validate or invalidate the initial idea. 
 The focus on testing specific ideas counters the concern that Build-Measure-LearnÂ is just throwing things against the wall and see if they work. 
 What Build-Measure-LearnÂ misses is that new ventures (both startups and new ideas in existing companies) donât start with âideasâÂ â they start with hypotheses (a fancy word for guesses). 
 Itâs important to understand that the words âidea â and âhypothesesâ mean two very different things. For most innovators the word âideaâ conjures up an insight that immediately requires a plan to bring it to fruition. In contrast, a hypothesis means we have an educated guessÂ that requires experimentation and data to validate or invalidate. 
 That the lean startup begins with acknowledging that your idea is simply a series of untested hypotheses is a big idea. Itâs a really big idea because what you build needs to match the hypothesis you want to test. 
 The minimum viable product youâll need to build to find theÂ right customers is different from the minimum viable product you need for testing pricing, which is different from an MVP you would build to test specific product features. And all of these hypotheses (and minimal viable products) change over time as you learn more. 
 SoÂ insteadÂ ofÂ Build-Measure-Learn,Â the diagram for building minimal viable products in a lean startup looks likeÂ Hypotheses â Experiments â Tests â Insights. 
 
 Lean Startup Methodology Pushback 
 
 Since the release of Riesâ book in 2011, there has been some  pushback against the lean startup methodology . One criticism is that itâs too easy to oversimplify â a valid criticism. There have been thousands of blog posts written about lean startup (including, obviously, this one) and blogs tend toward simplification. 
 Thatâs just the nature of the beast. 
 But, while lean startup might seem simple â and the basic elements certainly are â itâs a complex system. And like any system, you canât just pick and choose the parts that you like and leave the rest. 
 If youâre interested in using the lean startup methodology to build your next venture, do the research.  Read the books . Really study the methodology. 
 Itâs a research-intensive process, so consider this initial step a test to see if youâre up for the challenge. If you find yourself faltering, you might want to consider another approach. 
 And while its popularity might make it seem ubiquitous, lean startup also isnât the only model out there for launching a company. Check out the  Lean Analytics model , the  Effectuation  model, and  the Timmons model  for other examples of possible ways to build a successful startup.

 5 Must-Have Skills Startup Founders Can't Live Without   Startup 5 Must-Have Skills Startup Founders Can't Live Without     The to-do list is never-ending, especially if you're running a startup. Here are five key areas for entrepreneurs to focus on when rapidly trying to grow a business.   By    Sangram Vajre Co-founder and CMO, Terminus @   sangramvajre     Getty Images In a world where we are constantly checking  the to-do list  and racing from one meeting to another, how do successful startup founders, entrepreneurs, and CEOs manage to  stay focused  and rapidly grow a business? It's about knowing where to start by  defining what the matters most  to grow the business as quickly as possible, and center your efforts there.  Here are the five must-have skills every startup founder should hone: 1. Vision If you don't have a vision for what you want your organization to achieve, it's going to take a miracle for your team to follow along on your journey. The vision must extend to every aspect of the company, from the branding and messaging to the product and team you hire. Most importantly, the startup leader must live the vision. This starts with being crystal clear about the problem you're solving with your investors, customers and staff at every level. Embody the vision and your team will follow.  Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff is a great example of living out his vision . He's done a fabulous job building not only a transformational company but a category, too. 2. Funding Once you have a vision for what you want to achieve, knowing how--and when--to raise money is critical to business-building. One of the biggest traps a startup leader can fall into is failing to recognize when their company is running out of money. A CEO  has to understand his company's burn rate  in order to determine when it's going to need an influx of capital. Startup leaders should be checking their burn rates weekly, at least. This is key: You do not want to raise money when you're broke because you lose your negotiating leverage with investors. CEOs who miss this point will burn out before they can extend their runways. 3. Hiring No one said this better than Jim Collins: Get the right people on the bus first. People is what companies are made of, not technology or processes. Your people define your culture, and great people can be the difference between great companies and good companies.  Wrong hires can literally be the death of certain companies  as they could be a drain. The biggest consideration when hiring is always fit. I've made the mistake of hiring people who look great on paper but didn't fit our culture. In retrospect, it would've been better to not hire those people at all. Startup CEOs must emphasize culture first, and job title second. The reverse can be costly. 4. Experience Dharmesh Shah, co-founder and CTO of  HubSpot , wrote a thought-provoking post on how  the CEO should be the Chief Experience Officer  and it makes sense. This is especially true for startup CEOs. You're being pulled in a hundred directions. Failing to recognize the importance of delighting rather than satisfying customers can be a death knell. Selling product is crucial of course, but if the customer isn't successful, he or she will churn eventually. It's the responsibility of the startup CEO to ensure that the sales team understands not just what they're selling but how. Are they selling features or value? Are they delighting customers? Are they proactive with them? It's not about features and functions. Creating a meaningful experience can be a company's most important differentiator. 5. Leadership One of the key parts of being a startup leader is being fired up--so much so that because you're fired up, everyone around you feels your energy. This should come across every time you shake someone's hand, share a story, talk to a customer, meet a new employee or even send an email. What matters is how much you believe in what you do. You can't fake inspiration. Amazing leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Muhammad Ali spent enormous amounts of time perfecting every word in their speeches and how they spoke those words because they knew they wanted to inspire people. Just remember:  You can't fake leadership . You have to have it in you, or you won't be respected or trusted as a leader. To recap these five key areas of focus for startup leaders, CEOs, and entrepreneurs: 1. Vision  - dream big, and share your dream with your team, investors, and customers 2. Funding  - watch that burn rate! Know when to raise funds, or reign in spending 3. Hiring  -  bring on new team based on who they are, and not just job titles 4. Experience  - surprise and delight all your customers (both internal and external) 5. Leadership  - believe in what you do and others will too By paying attention to these core skills, startup CEOs will be more prepared to weather the storms of competition, product issues, and unpredictable customer demand.

 As we shift to the future of work, where organizations are focusing on the reasons why employees  want  to work versus  need  to work, it is important to understand employee experience. A lot of organizations historically have focused only on one aspect of organizational change and that is culture. This is how employees feel when they are inside of an organization, the vibe that they get, the organizational structure, leadership style, compensation and benefits, etc. While culture is a part of the employee experience, it is only a third. 
 Employee experience is the combination of three distinct things that exist within any organization regardless of industry, size, and location. The other parts of employee experience are the technological environment and the physical environment. The technological environment is the tools an employee needs to do their job, including the user interface, mobile devices, and desktop computers. An organization should provide relevant and modern tools that allow employees to get their job done. The physical environment includes anything that can be seen, heard, touched, and tasted like the desks, chairs, art, and meals. This is crucial because employees spend most of their time inside the organization so it should have a positive effect on them. All three of these aspects should be focused on to create an environment where people want to show up!

"What Is a Product Manager, Actually?",https://medium.com/@Alex.Valaitis/what-is-a-product-manager-actually-f328f05575,"What Is a Product Manager, Actually? - Alex Valaitis - Medium Visual Design Become a member Sign in Get started What Is a Product Manager, Actually? Alex Valaitis Follow Oct 2, 2017     ·       8    min read While my company has certainly influenced a lot of my thinking in this area, it is important to note that the contents below reflect my opinion and not that of my employer. Background In many ways, the role of a Product Manager remains an enigma. Many companies have only begun inserting the role into their organizations in recent years, and very few companies incorporate the role correctly. As a result, the role of a Product Manager has been misconstrued and practiced incorrectly by many in the industry. I am fortunate to be working for a company in Intuit that has truly mastered the art of Product Management over the years, and I wish to share my learnings so that others may improve their craft as well. After all, better Product Managers leads to better products, and we all win when we have better products in our lives. I also want to clarify that the type of Product Manager I will be describing is one that generally works in the technology space, but more specifically, works with software products. What a Product Manager Is Not Before diving into what a Product Manager is, I think it is important to start by laying out what a PM is not. I see many people label themselves as PM’s, but when they describe their role to me it is far from being that of a PM. I cringe when this happens, because it further contorts the perception of the role in the industry. Here are a list of incorrect PM descriptions I commonly encounter: A Product Manager is NOT a Software Developer or Engineer If you spend most of your day writing code or building product, then you are a developer/engineer not a PM. You should rarely (if ever) be doing these tasks. The reason is that there are far too many other tasks that you need to be doing with your time, and they will not get completed if a PM does not own them. A Product Manager Is NOT a Designer Similar to engineering or development, design is a separate function of its own. While it never hurts to churn out some high fidelity mock-ups as a PM, this is a space that should ideally be owned by experience designers (XD). In some small organizations there may be exceptions, however in an ideal scenario this work should not be owned exclusively by a PM. A Product Manager Is NOT a Software Architect The how is not decided by a PM. It never hurts to have the technical expertise to keep up and make suggestions, however the high-level software design choices and technical standards should be driven by someone who is completely dedicated to this area. A Product Manager Is NOT an Analyst or a Consultant If you’re not driving a team that’s building product, then you are not a PM. Period. While there may be stretches of time where you do hands off research and analysis (say in the discovery stages of a product), this should not be the nature of your work for extended periods of time. A Product Manager Is NOT Any of These Things Either: Customer Support, Marketing, Project/Program Manager, Data Scientist, Sales, etc. For various reasons, a Product Manager is not any of the things listed above either. While a solid PM will interact with many of these functions, no single one of these areas should be commanding the majority of your time in the long run. One last example… A Product Manager Is NOT an Authoritarian Figure As a Product Manager you have no authority over other people . While you do drive decisions and the product vision, you can’t force others to follow it.  As a PM, you must lead through influence.  One of my biggest triggers is when I see a PM trying to lead with authority instead of influence. Attempting to strong-arm developers or designers into doing what you want will always lead to poor products in the long run. So what is a Product Manager, Actually? Now that we have a solid understanding of all of the things that a Product Manager is not, let’s deep dive into what a Product Manager actually is. I’ve heard a lot of people try to describe the role in different ways, but perhaps the best analogy I have heard is the following: A Product Manager is the Quarterback of a product. source:  http://legacy.wbur.org I’ve heard the phrase “CEO of the product” tossed around, but I think it is a poor analogy. A Product Manager does not have authoritative control over a team, similar to how a quarterback does not control the football team. She can’t bench any of her teammates if they don’t execute the plays she calls, only the coach can do that. Another major difference is that unlike CEO’s, Product Managers are down in the trenches executing with the team. It is not merely a strategic role for setting high-level vision, since you have to get your hands dirty on a daily basis. Another correlation between a PM and a quarterback, is that you need to be able to work with and have the trust of the entire team. Each drive, a quarterback may interact with the running back, offensive line, tight ends, and wide-receivers. It is not an isolated position that only has one focus. Similarly, a PM must gain the trust of the entire team and be able to work cross-functionally in order to guarantee the success of a product. Ultimately, a quarterback is responsible for calling plays based on the information they see in front of them, and are required to make quick decisions on the fly to ensure that a drive is successful. In a nutshell, that is what a product manager is expected to do for a product. What Does a Product Manager Do? I’m sure there are some people reading this that are rolling their eyes right now, so I want to conclude by giving a rundown of what a Product Manager actually does. This isn’t a simple explanation, since a PM’s daily work activities can morph depending on what stage of the product development life cycle they are in. Generally speaking there are 3 different phases that PM’s will find themselves in: Discovery, Planning and Execution. Discovery Phase Before a team can begin building product, someone must go out and discover what needs to be built. A Product Manager is tasked with finding the most important problems and defining which of them should be solved. Generally speaking, there are two sources that PM’s can use during the discovery phase: Data and Customers. If you already have an existing product and are looking to build out new features or capabilities, data can give you clues as to where the product opportunities will be. Great PM’s know how to use analytics tools to access fingertip data and how to enlist the support of data scientists or analytics teams for deeper data dives. Often times data is too muddy or small in order to draw product conclusions. That is why it is important to supplement quantitative insights with feedback from customers. Customer interviews are a great way to gain qualitative feedback from current or prospective users. Product Managers should seek to to spend a significant amount of time with customers during the discovery phase of the product life cycle. Planning Phase After pouring through data and spending time with customers, it is up to a Product Manager to help prioritize which products or features are worth pursuing. Unfortunately, all companies have limited time and resources, so it is essential that PM’s define the right priorities for the company to pursue. The larger the company a PM operates in, the more involved the planning phase will be. Because there are so many moving pieces, it is not always as straight-forward as picking the most data or customer-backed projects to pursue. Organizations must factor in other internal projects, technical requirements, time of year, budgets, risk factors, etc. Due to the importance of the planning stage, PM’s will most likely find themselves in numerous meetings with leadership and other relevant stakeholders. During these meetings PM’s will present their findings and suggestions for the road map, while working towards gaining approval from leadership. More often than not, these meetings are taking place while the rest of the team continues to execute on the current initiatives. Execution Phase Image Credit:  Sean O'Connor Outside of discovery and planning, a Product Manager will spend the majority of her time in the execution phase. I borrowed the graphic above from a fellow PM at Intuit, because I think it does a great job of laying out where a PM sits during the execution phase of a product. Starting with the build section, a PM is expected to work closely with the development and design functions. At Intuit we refer to this as the “product triad”. A PM will complete a number of activities while working with the triad including: working with designers to craft mock ups, defining requirements for developers, tracking development processes , and running usability tests with customers. The build cycle should never really end for a product, since teams should constantly be seeking to improve their products. Once a product is built, it is important that a PM works with marketing and design to ensure that the product gets the right exposure in the marketplace. A PM is important to this phase as he will understand what aspects of the product need to be emphasized in order to excite potential users. Lastly, a PM should be in close contact with Support/Operations to ensure that the product is functioning well at all times. Service outages, crashes, and bugs are all issues that inevitably arise with any software product. A PM must closely track these issues and ensure that they do not get in the way of a great user experience. Conclusion Unlike many other functions, if a PM were to stop coming in to work one day, the team probably wouldn’t feel the effects right away. However, over time the lack of PM expertise would shine through in the products that are delivered to market. The truth is that almost any person can be a Product Manager, however very few people can become great Product Managers. The job is 90% effort & discipline and 10% raw talent. If you think you have what it takes, I encourage you to try!

 Boxology: The Mythical Science of Organizational Change 
 July 19, 2019 May 22, 2014   by  AlignOrg    .entry-header  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Altering the organization’s structure might be necessary, but approaching change by changing the organization chart alone is insufficient in most cases. Over the years, a pseudo-science has emerged that focuses on finding the perfect organization chart. We call this  boxology . Even if a perfect organization chart did exist (with the right spans of control, optimal layers of management, proper placement of talent, clear decision rights, etc.), structure is just one aspect of organization design. 
 Organizations  are complex systems, with changes in one area cascading and sometimes setting off changes throughout the entire system. Moreover, organizations operate in complex environments with market forces, competitors’ behaviors, and regulatory requirements demanding that an organization continually change and adapt. 
 One risk of boxology is that it ignores the interdependency of organizational components like work, culture, structure, metrics, rewards, etc. It ignores the deep connections of those components to forces at play in the organization’s environment. It also ignores the reality of how work is done, who makes decisions, and how resources are allocated. Truly effective organization design is about finding the optimal alignment of all of these components—not simply trying to optimize the structure of the organization. Indeed, structure only enables or disables  strategy . In and of itself, structure doesn’t create or deliver value to the customer. 
 Companies don’t usually transform themselves into their aspirations unless  leaders  have thoughtfully considered the dynamics of their business environment, the changing needs of customers, and the degree to which their current  capabilities  and talent can successfully meet those conditions. Leaders need to make fundamental  strategic choices  and then align the org structure and the many systems of the organization (technological systems, reward and compensation systems, recruiting and talent management systems, etc.) to that strategy. They need to align decision-making rights, resource allocation, even assess the culture of an organization in order to reach the new desired state. It’s a little more complicated than moving boxes.

The Power of Bad Product Ideas,http://www.mindtheproduct.com/2017/03/power-bad-product-ideas,"The Power of Bad Product Ideas

BY CHRIS MASSEY ON MARCH 6, 2017

Steve Portigal challenges product managers to re-think the idea-generation process by inviting in bad ideas.

In brain-storming sessions, we frequently see two surges in ideas. The first is where the low hanging fruit is identified. The second surge is where more innovative ideas are frequently found. Welcoming bad ideas can be an effective strategy for fast tracking past the low hanging fruit and into innovation.

Steve’s interactive talk encourages product managers to come up with the worst product ideas possible. Not the ideas that are just not that good, but ones that are really, truly terrible. By starting with a bad idea, Steve opens a safe, creative space for ideas sharing. He helps product people to unpack what is good and bad, why and who gets to decide. He encourages us to step away from the binary of good and bad to move around the problem space in a different way. His bad ideas approach also breaks the idea-generation ice – by starting with something terrible, space is opened for all ideas, allowing creativity to flow.

Sharing Terrible Ideas

Steve identifies two types of bad idea sharing, proactive disruption vs tentative unfinished ideas – and encourages us to recognise and support those who share both. The first type of sharing breaks open space for a different approach to your problem or market. The second invites you to listen, collaborate and make a bad thing good.

Bad ideas expose our own beliefs about what the criteria are for good and bad and force us to reassess. Bad ideas can go good, context is everything and ultimately bad can only be judged by the marketplace. If an idea is stupid but it works, its not stupid.

Steve’s talk encourages you to be open to surprises and to capture new energy in your team by being playful with the ideas generation process and laughing as you go.

Maybe you picked up Clay Christensen’s 2016 book “Competing Against Luck” or you’ve seen the #jtbd hashtag on Twitter. You’re interested in this idea that “customers want to make progress in their lives and they hire products to help them get that job done” and how it can help  you  make progress. Unfortunately, this seemingly simple little theory has amassed a daytime-television-worthy level of intrigue and drama. Little JTBD has (at least) two men who can lay claim to have originated the approach, and others who have raised it as their own and expect some credit too. The irony of course is what the argument is over. Laying claim to the belief that: Customers don’t care about your product. They care about what it helps them do. The product in question? The ‘right’ approach to surfacing and applying JTBD insights. As an innovation and strategy consultant, my goal is to help my clients consistently create winning products. I’m purposely methodology-agnostic. That being said, I see a lot of value in looking at problems through the “Jobs to be Done” lens.

 Generating Startup Ideas 
 
 /post-meta  
 
 
 
  “I want to start a company, but I haven’t found a great idea.”
 
 I hear this a lot. Even among entrepreneurs who have started companies, many of them focus on the novelty of the idea. Which is understandable, especially within the 140 character attention span we now live in. 
 Able to be summarized into elevator sized pitches, the misplaced emphasis on the idea results in entrepreneurs spending too many hours rewriting a handful of words, hoping people will ‘get it.’ Wanting the listener to acknowledge the huge potential, its easy to get paralyzed trying to justify why their idea is smarter than the next. 
 This is the wrong way to think about it. 
 The reality is that initial ideas are often irrelevant. Like clay being sculpted on a spinning wheel, it takes a lot of trying, learning, and adjusting to turn initial instincts into a masterpiece. It can even require starting over along the way, until you really understand the potential of what you are building. 
 As @benhorowitz reminds us,  “the trouble with innovation is that truly innovative ideas often look like bad ideas at the time.“ 
 So how do you generate an ‘idea’ that is strong enough to start a company? 
 Forget About Your Idea 
The hardest part is to begin with an unbiased opinion. Starting this process with a pre determined idea shuts out your ability to really understand the essence of the problem. It becomes so personal that you can’t separate the true opportunity from your own desire to be right. 
 Being stuck to an idea results in mistakes like these… 
 
 Your customer research is tainted with questions like, “would you use a service that does blah.” A yes makes you feel good, but doesn’t actually help you understand the customer’s problem. 
 Your pricing is based on asking people if they would pay X for your imaginary product. A question that doesn’t truly gets answered until people pay you money. 
 
 You raise too much money before your product sticks. Investor interest doesn’t necessarily mean customers will love what you build. 
 
 You brand your company ‘the product’, wanting to make no mistake that people will know what your service does. Except when you have to change your product you then realize the name you spent months driving awareness for now has nothing to do with the final direction of the company. 
 Start With The Problem 
Ultimately you want to  understand the problem better than anyone else.  Having a distinct advantage in customer understanding, enables you to deliver a solution that no one else would conclude. Peter Thiel calls this  developing a secret. There are a variety of ways to discover an interesting problem. Personally I first list what I’m passionate about and second explore problems within these passions. Starting with a pen and paper, I start building lists. 1.What Are You Passionate About? 
These can be activities (i.e. being active), experiences (i.e. listening to music), tools (i.e. cameras), efficiencies (i.e. ways to save time). utilities (i.e. clothing), interactions (i.e. meeting new people), or even consumables (i.e. food). I find there are about 5-6 areas everyone is super passionate about and if they pick a problem to solve in one of these arenas they will be significantly more motivated. The last list I personally built… 
 * enabling people to start their own business 
 * music 
 * staying active 
 * photography 
 * traveling 
 * local food experiences Moment  began from my passion for taking pictures. 2.A Day In The Life 
A second way is to walking through your day, listing out all the things you do, where you do them, and what tools you use. If you want to solve a problem that every one has, likely the problem will be associated with one of these key parts of your life. As you build a list you can start brainstorming things that frustrate you, that you find broken, or that you would love to make better within each of these areas. Map The Customer Journey 
Picking one item from the list, you can start to explore the problems through the entire journey. Thinking about what happens before, during, and after you begin to identify interesting problems to solve. As an example, my wife and I are passionate about traveling. We have found that discovering new places brings us closer together. Always trying to find local, off the beaten path locations, we have spent a lot of time in other countries. Mapping out our typical travel experience, I list out the interactions before we travel, while we travel, and what happens afterwards. Starting with a longer list I’d reduce our travel routine down… 
 * Discover: finding new, inspiring places to visit. 
 * Travel: from coordinating to experiencing adventures. 
 * Remember: enabling us and loved ones to remember the trip. Starting with ‘how’ we accomplish these tasks today, I can begin to find dozens of interesting problems to solve. Thinking about what is broken, frustrating, or a poor experience, I start sketching out potential solutions. This cycle can continue for weeks until I have a concentric circle that represents what I would build before, during, and after. And within that framework will be an initial problem that I believe I can solve better than anyone. If I was to build a startup in the travel space it would probably be around enabling travelers with better tools to discover local, authentic experiences. Getting people excited about the vision of ‘enabling’, is a much easier than trying to convince everyone why my travel idea and its key features, are genius enough to join. Frequency vs Pain 
If you are building consumer based products I use a matrix that compares the frequency people have this problem (daily to never) against the type of pain (physical to emotional) that customers feel. The more frequent the problem occurs, the more important your product will become. Here is how I break down the quadrants: 
 * Upper Left: a physical pain that doesn’t happen very often – i.e. a heart attack. 
 * Upper Right: a physical pain that happens daily – i.e. taking insulin. 
 * Lower Left: an emotional pain that doesn’t happen often – i.e. buying a car. 
 * Lower Right: an emotional pain that happens often – i.e. too many emails. Most of the products that startups build fall into the bottom half of this quadrant. These solutions provide emotional and/or mental benefit to the customers. Personal travel would fall in the lower left quadrant. Although personal traveling makes people happy, it happens so infrequently that its hard to build a sustainable business. Unless you focus on business travelers, the average person is lucky to take a handful of trips in a year. Find A Passionate Niche 
I’m a big believer in finding a passionate niche that you can own. Even though investors will want to know when your idea is mass market, it’s important to build creditability with an avid user base. Creating  1,000 true fans  is really hard and if you try to move past this group too early, your company has the risk of becoming irrelevant. Just look at… 
 *  Apple with creatives. 
 * Sportscenter with tis 24 hour sports fans. 
 *  GrabCad  with engineers. 
 * Firefox with the  open source community. 
 * Twitter with the tech community. 
 * Instagram with photographers. These companies anchored their brand and initial products within a passionate group of users, which were obsessed with using their product on a daily basis. Look For A Wave 
How big can this be, is the first question that investors will ask you.  Even more important than team, hitting a market with avid customers at the right time is critical. As  Marc Andreesen says , “You can obviously screw up a great market — and that has been done, and not infrequently — but assuming the team is baseline competent and the product is fundamentally acceptable, a great market will tend to equal success and a poor market will tend to equal failure. Market matters most.” But trying to predict how big your company is going to be, especially early on, is a self actualizing process. Searching google for random market numbers doesn’t actually give you confidence that you have hit the opportunity at the right time. Instead I believe what Chris Dixon wrote a few years ago about  sizing the market based on a narrative. Being in front of a rising wave is the right place to be. The action camera market is a great example. When Contour and GoPro started there was no wave behind action video. Myspace was just beginning, YouTube didn’t exists, and consumers weren’t carrying computers in their pockets. The initial market was reserved for adrenaline junkies who were willing to strap a lens on their helmet and spend countless hours downloading their footage on expensive computers. All of that changed with the arrival of social media. The need to prove status, likes, and audience size created a tidal wave of demand for designated cameras that could capture the most amazing adventures. The more interesting the content, the more popular the users could become. Without social, it’s questionable if GoPro would be the $B company that it is today. Examples of other waves… 
 *  Stance Socks : differentiating ourselves continues to drive shopping decisions. 
 * Beats by Dre: the continued growth in mobile music and  the subsequent need for better consumption tools. 
 * Box: the  once in a lifetime shift  in how people work. 
 * Instagram: the 1.2B consumers with cameras in their pockets need a place to share their pictures. Start With Projects 
It’s very hard to sit down and come up with a world changing, job quitting idea. The journey to what you ultimately build is an organic path that shapes over time. Even the tools to understand the customer, their needs, and the right market are merely guides. Ultimately you learn the most when you put a product in someone’s hands. If you have a day job, start working on side projects with people you like. And if you don’t have friends who want to work on side projects, attend a  Startup Weekend  and meet dozens of people that share your same passion to build. At some point this journey will lead you to an interesting problem that aligns your passion with a need that millions of people share. Focus on the problem, not the idea. *Image Credit:  Ramunas Geciauskas  via Creative Commons.  Begin MailChimp Signup Form

 The approach is more like one of a ‘Marketing Consultant’. Startup ideas are never ever generated the way described here. The steps here is helpful in validating or shaping your startup idea but not generating one. So how do you get startup idea? It either clicks, blinks, sparks or just is around but no one have shaped it well. It mostly borrowed from other ideas or some running product or a problem that you encounter.

 Everyone arrives at ideas in their own way, but I find there is a process to discovering opportunities. A lot of it comes from design thinking and user research. We used this exact process to start Moment.  
 None of this is how a marketing consultant would work. Marketing an existing product/company is very different from starting something new. There is nothing to consult until you have built a product that people want.

 I’m at a start-up that is currently in the middle of a pivot, and we all read this article as a tool to get everyone in the same mindset so we can brainstorm our next product. Excellent read.

 Good luck with the pivot. I find digging deep to why you started the company uncovers a lot of core problems/frustrations you wanted to solve that got skipped. Within the why is usually where you find the answers and from that you can identify interesting problems you want to solve.

 Editor’s Note:   We are pleased to bring you this guest column by Joy Levin on the topic of market research, as a companion guide to the small business market research we conduct and make available here at Small Business Trends. Joy sheds light on the different types of research, how to get it and how to use it.  placeholder 154 blocked.  Reason : no sizes  
 By Joy Levin 
 Small businesses often find themselves in a challenging situation. These businesses have a great need for reliable answers to important questions that all organizations face: 
 
 How are market trends impacting my business? 
 
 
 How does our target market make buying decisions? 
 
 
 What is our market share and how can we increase it? 
 
 
 How does customer satisfaction with our products or services measure up to that of the competition? 
 
 
 How will our existing customers respond to a new product or service? 
 
 
 How can we attract new customer segments? 
 
 
 What marketing strategies will work best? 
 
  placeholder 155 blocked.  Reason : no sizes  In order to get answers to these questions, companies conduct marketing research using a variety of methods. This article will outline some of these methods and illustrate how they can benefit a small business. All have some value, but it is important to know the limitations of each technique. 
 I. SECONDARY RESEARCH 
 This type of research involves looking at information that has already been conducted and published, by exploring a few different types of resources: 
 1. Demographics and Statistics 
 This information can be helpful to businesses when trying to learn more about the geographic areas in which they operate, or those into which it would make sense to expand. Where are other people like my current customers? Where are there people who are a little different from my customer base but might find my product valuable? I’m introducing a new product to an entirely new market — where do these prospects live? Is the size of the potential market big enough to make the investment into a new product worthwhile?  placeholder 156 blocked.  Reason : no sizes  
 Similarly, this type of research, called statistical profiling, also benefits business to business marketers. For example, if you are selling to businesses locally, you can expand your base by finding other areas where there is a high concentration of similar businesses. Or, you may have been selling to one type of industry, but you think companies in a different industry will also buy your product. 
 Here are some free online  resources  that can help you find these businesses and get relevant statistics: 
  placeholder 157 blocked.  Reason : no sizes  Bureau of Labor Statistics  
Internet Public Library 
Fed Stats 
American Marketing Association – Demographic Statistics 
Demographic data by zip code for every U.S. state 
 2. Existing Research Reports 
 Often, businesses have questions that involve trends in their markets. For example, which customers are adapting the lastest technology? How is internet usage changing among mature adults? 
 There may already be a report that was conducted that can give you some general information into your industry and specific market. By doing a search on “online research reports,” you can find a listing of companies that provide these reports. Usually they do come at a cost, but may be less expensive than doing a study from scratch. A good idea is to first peruse the table of contents that often comes with these reports before buying, in order to get an idea as to whether the purchase would be justified. 
 3. Marketing Researcher tools 
 Why not go where the pros do? By utilizing these sites, you can ask questions of marketing professionals and use the tools they do. There are some excellent resources available, again some of which require a fee, but others do not.

 II. PRIMARY RESEARCH  
 At some point, all businesses need to ask specific questions of their customers, as well as those individuals who are not their customers, in order to make decisions regarding their business and marketing strategy. This is where research can get expensive, though. Many small businesses do not have resources required for studies that deliver the most unbiased, accurate data. However, there are ways that companies can get guidance and direction for marketing strategy, based on customer feedback. 
 1. Talk to Your Customers 
 Is there any more direct, less expensive way to go? Ask your customers questions when they purchase from you, if you can do so in a way that is not cumbersome for them and doesn’t take a lot of their time. What made them purchase from you? How did they hear about you? 
 Make it worth their time to give you feedback — perhaps a discount on their next order. And let them know that their feedback will help you serve them better in the future — which it should. And many small businesses overlook or discount input from their direct salesforce, a resource that can generate some of the best ideas for new products due to close customer contact. 
 2. Web Logs or Blogs 
 This is a great way to get customer feedback. Start a blog on your company website, tell your customers about it, and post information about your products and services. I know what you’re thinking, though – what if my customers have negative reactions about what I post? Won’t my warts be available for all to see? 
 Marketing diva, Toby Bloomberg,  recently had a post on her own blog about just this issue . As she points out, your customers talk anyway — isn’t it better to see what they’re saying so you can respond? And Toby makes a great point — negative comments are an excellent way of showing how you respond to customer concerns. 
 3. Yahoo Groups 
 Start a group for your customers. This is a great way for them to talk to each other and exchange information. At the same time, you get to see what they’re saying without them necessarily knowing that you’re peeking. 
 Additionally, some customers can start conversations that allow you to get insights into their interests — more valuable information that can help you in your product/service development efforts. These groups can also exchange tips about using the product or service – some which may have never occurred to you. 
 4. In-person forums/ conferences 
 This is a great way to educate and entertain your customers and provide them value for their attendance at an offline function. While the methods above can often limit the amount of information you get from your customers, these forums and conferences allow you to explore various issues in a more in-depth way. 
 User conferences also can give you a great opportunity to introduce your customers to new uses for your product or service, by highlighting customer success stories and case studies for presentation. 
 However, as noted above, these resources usually do not provide completely accurate and unbiased information, and to get this type of customer data, you’ll need to use more structured and traditional methods. Unbiased, quantifiable information can be very powerful in planning your marketing strategy. And every successful business needs to, and will get to this stage at some point. The trick is not to wait very long, because your competitors can start getting the answers before you do. 
 In general, there are two main types of traditional primary research studies, each with its own benefits: 
 5. Qualitative 
 These studies, also often called exploratory research, allow you to research issues with customers in an in-depth manner. While qualitative studies usually aren’t designed to give you precise answers, they can give you great insight into the behavior of your customers, their rationale for making decisions, and factors that can motivate them to purchase. 
 There are various forms of qualitative studies, including focus groups, one-on-one interviews, and newer techniques called ethnography. What sets these apart from the user conferences mentioned above, are several factors: 
 
 They are typically led by an objective moderator, so participants often will provide more honest and less biased feedback. 
 A trained professional can also handle different types of respondents, from those who tend to be very vocal to those who are less likely to speak. 
 They are in a controlled setting, and the moderator has a pre-defined script so that the most important issues at hand are addressed. 
 A variety of techniques can be used, in order to get at the thinking behind customer discussions and behavior. 
 These studies can be done both on the internet and in person. A qualified professional can help you to determine the right method to use, and the costs for your particular situation. 
 
 6. Quantitative 
 Often businesses need guidance on a set of marketing issues that require clearly defined measures, for example, advertising spending, distribution channel usage, pricing decisions, segmentation sizes, and the product or service message that should be launched first. 
 Surveys and questionnaires can give you a great deal of accuracy when asking marketing questions that require this level of detail for sound decision-making. For example, which product will generate the highest level of interest? Are there differences between different segments and how are these differences are best defined? What price should you set? How often will people purchase? There are some great online tools you can use to develop your own surveys — here are just a few that offer free versions: 
 Survey Monkey 
Zoomerang 
 Cool Surveys 
 However, it is important to note that according to the Small Business Administration website, much primary research, particularly “… surveys, interviews, and questionnaires, is best left to marketing professionals, as they can usually get more objective and sophisticated results.” 
 CONCLUSION 
 Every organization needs to conduct research, and small budgets are no excuse for lack of a research plan. By starting out with some easily accessible resources, you can begin to develop better marketing strategies that can position you for market growth.

 This is a well-written article on the value of research by small business owners. One of the fascinating things about this research is that how much information is available and the author presented a number of excellent sources, Small business owners have tremendous advantages to use this information. Small business owners are nimble, and can be decisive to make valuable changes to get the most out of the new trends discovered in the research encouraged by the writer. 
 Bigger businesses (read corporations) have committees, politics and many other large obstacles to adjusting to new trends, And when they finally do adjust it takes lots of time and effort to do so. By then nimble small business owners will be adjusting to the newer trends the corporations have pointed out themselves in the research they paid for. 
 Keeping in touch with the trends can be very profitable and fun.

 As posted, it can be noticed that there are several ways to gather data for use in a businesses marketing procedures. From using the demographics and zeroing in on the target market, their are various useful forms to attain useful data.  
 Now as far as gathering the research information, and now focusing on group studies, one must remember that the consumer can have various New ideas for creating a better product, and that can be extremely useful to the improvement of an existing idea. How? The consumer is the end user who will undoubtably know what he or she wants in the product. And that is very important as this creates a better product, which in turn will satisfy the end user and benefit the businesses that provide the items. 
 So in conclusion, talking with the consumers and having the all the right questions to ask them is a key factor. If you don’t know what to ask, it is probably better to hire a company that focuses on this speciality research. They will be able to provide better results for a business.

 A prime example of the power of marketing research *and* the internet is that while this post may be 2 1/2 years old, but it’s still relevant – and a great *find* for me this morning. Thanks.

 Growth Hacking: How to Implement an A/B Testing Model

 SHARES 
 Facebook Twitter Linkedin Reddit Print Buffer Pocket    Share buttons by mashshare.net - Version: 3.6.9 As a growth hacker, you need to cultivate a sense of scientific curiosity. Almost every element of your marketing strategy or  business plan  can—and should—be viewed as an experiment, with the data guiding your next move. Even lackluster or failed experiments tell you a lot about what’s working, what’s not, and what direction to try next. The epitome of a growth hacker’s scientific mindset is A/B testing (or “split testing”). In this model, you divide your audience or customer base into two groups, with one acting as a control group. Each group receives a distinct version of your email campaign, landing page, discount offer, or the like, and you carefully track each version’s performance. By looking at the results, you can tweak your strategy as needed, then go on to test another element. Optimization Testing A/B optimization testing is used to try out how changes to a minor element of an existing process affect customer engagement. The goal is to optimize the impact of that process,  getting the best results with the lowest cost to your company. Most frequently, A/B testing is used to test how different versions of one  digital marketing  campaign perform; for example, the two groups see two different designs of a website, or receive two variants of the same email blast. Typically, optimization tests compare the results—measured in click-throughs, email opens, social engagement, conversions, or by some other metric—of minute changes to design, wording, or visual elements. Does a long email subject or a shorter one result in more opens? Does a green button or a red button get more clicks? Does a Facebook post with an image get more likes than one without? Because the tests measure audience engagement or other results based on very small changes, with little or no cost for each test, companies may perform many thousands of A/B tests per year. The data from testing then informs the next campaign. Structuring an A/B Test Like any good experiment, A/B testing is rooted in the scientific method. A refresher course on the scientific method: ask a question based on observation and research. Make a hypothesis about the answer to this question. Next, formulate testable predictions, collect data, and use the data to measure the accuracy of your hypothesis. Growth hacking (and any  digital marketing ) has an added step here: tweak your test based on results. Then retest, retest, retest. Once you have come up with come up with a question and a hypothesis—and done some background research into your audience’s current behaviors using analytics—it’s time to design your test. Some factors to consider: 
 Changes Per Variation  
 How much will version B differ from the control group’s? You can make many changes from the A version to B, or (more typically) just one. Single changes may take longer to see results, or may not show results as dramatic as a total overhaul, but it’s easier to track responses and the causes of responses. When making many changes, any one of them could be prompting the result you’re seeing. 
 Metric for Data 
How will you measure your results? If you are testing the effectiveness of an email campaign’s subject line, for example, it makes sense to use the metric of number of email opens. If you’re testing a change to an onboarding procedure, on the other hand,  sign-ups  or other forms of conversion provide your data. 
 Test Scope 
 What is the scale and timeline of your test? When testing something small like a change in the wording of email copy, results will be evident very quickly. Use a tool like  VWO’s A/B Split and Multivariate Test Duration Calculator  or  Evan Miller’s sample size calculator  to determine either how many days you will run the test, or how many audience members you will include in your sample. 
 Segmentation 
 Who will be the subjects of your test? If you have a good sense of how your audience is segmented, you can run A/B tests on one specific part of your audience, or set up one portion as your A group and one as the B group. 
 Strategic A/B Testing Strategic testing  applies  the same principles of optimization testing to larger, more important elements of your marketing strategy, or even your entire business philosophy. If you are launching a new product, offering new pricing, or changing your branding strategy, the stakes of such a change are high. It makes sense to test this kind of big move with a small part of your audience first before deploying it across the board. Strategic tests tend to be run much less frequently than optimization testing: the stakes in terms of profits and marketing budget are much higher, the moving pieces are bigger (a new brand strategy takes a long time to change, and then to see results), and more people are involved. But there are definite benefits to testing a strategic change on a small target audience: it gives you a sense of whether the initiative will succeed with your entire consumer base, and helps you  refine  your approach if it’s not quite ready for prime time. What You Can Do Right Now A/B testing is a valuable tool for getting the most out of your strategy, whether on a small scale   optimizing  an email campaign) or on a large one (a wide-spread sales promotion). Ready to give it a shot? Here’s how to get going. 
 Start small. For your first A/B test, choose something low-cost and low-risk: a minimal change to  your email  blasts, social media postings, or website. Starting with one small change has the added benefit of showing definitive cause-and-effect results. 
 Be very clear about the goal of your testing and about how you will measure results. 
 Set a defined test period or number of subjects. Keep the scale appropriate to your experience with A/B testing, your resources, and the type of initiative you’re testing (bigger changes often take longer to show results).

Searching for Product/Market Fit,http://www.mindtheproduct.com/2016/06/searching-product-market-fit,"Searching for Product/Market Fit

BY CHRIS MASSEY ON JUNE 7, 2016

Rodrigo Madanes has got 25 years of experience designing and developing successful web and mobile products at companies such as Skype and eBay. Rodrigo will talk about exploring product/market Fit, sharing his lessons learned about first focusing on the needs of a specific user segment. Rodrigo dives into what it means to find product/market fit, some techniques for finding it, and how long it can take. By way of example: At Skype, in their early-adopter phase, they still had 40-50 million registered users. The wave can take 10-15 years, and it’s not about size of user base.

How Do You Recognise Product/Market Fit?

If you’re sensible, after launching your product you’ll spend some time searching for product/market Fit before you try and aggressively take what you believe your market to be. But working out when you have product/market fit is a tricky thing. Having a growing user base doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re solving a real problem for a defined market, or that you’ve built something that people actually want – it might just mean that you have great marketing.

Size of user-base isn’t actually that helpful, so you need to try and look for other behaviours and, more importantly, more specific segments of your audience. Do you get a lot of return visitors? Do you have good Net Promoter Scores? Are your users giving you money? Do you have stable cohort retention curves? These are the signs that indicate a potential product/market fit!

Once you’ve found that fit, then you should go out and find all the people who make up that audience, and finally take the market. As observed by Marc Andreessen, a startup really has two very different phases of existence – Before Fit and After Fit – and thus two different sets of goals and behaviours. Don’t get those two mixed up.

What Next?

Taking this a step further, you need to find the specific set of features that matters to a specific, defined market, then work out exactly how to reach that market (i.e. which channels to use) and invest just in those! However, you’ll likely find, as most startups do, that although you’ll get a ramp-up in users when you hit product/market fit, your growth will gradually plateau. It’s important to remember that growth is bumpy, and as your first product/market fit growth spurt starts to slow, you should already be looking into the next set of features that will trigger another round of fit-based growth.

Next, it’s important to focus on the intensity of NPS (or some other measure of user love for your product). Put simply, if you try and build something for everyone, you’ll build something that’s great for nobody. Focus on the users who really love your product, and build for them, as they’re more likely to be a defined market, and they’re more likely to help you grow.

And finally, on the topic of defined markets, focus on specific segments of your potential audience. Realistically, your audience is a complex and multi-faceted mess of different types of people, so you need to investigate (using things like cohort analysis and segmentation) to work out exactly what defines your market (e.g. what mobile platform they’re using, location, wealth, life stages…), and then work out how to reach them.

WhatsApp’s Revenue Model  by  Aashish Pahwa  · Last updated on October 3rd, 2019,       64 shares   57   1       3   1           2               WhatsApp was developed by Jan Koum and Brian Acton in early months of 2009 as a  status update application  (hence the name WhatsApp). It was further updated to Whatsapp 2.0 which transformed it into an Instant Messaging Application and started the real story. This Facebook-owned IM Application now provides service to more than 1 Billion users all over the world. But the question of how does Whatsapp make money has been in the minds of everyone ever since the beginning as WhatsApp proudly expresses its views against native advertisements and hasn’t been charging its users for a long time. There surely are some big plans in the minds of developers (and Facebook) regarding its  revenue model . Table of Contents 1  How does WhatsApp Make Money? 1.1  Initial Revenue Generation Strategy 2  WhatsApp’s Revenue Model (Facebook’s Strategy) 2.1  WhatsApp Business 2.1.1  WhatsApp for Business API 2.2  Payments 2.3  Future Revenue Earning Strategies How does WhatsApp Make Money? WhatsApp doesn’t earn revenue through advertisements. The founders hated advertisements and created this ad-free platform focusing just on great user experience and interface. They wanted to create an instant messaging platform for the users and  not for the big companies to place ads . But at the same time, they had to pay their bills too. So they decided to come up with the paid version of the application where they charged an annual fee of $1 from the users. Initial Revenue Generation Strategy WhatsApp got its first round of funding of $250k by five ex-Yahoo! friends who were granted a co-founder status. The second and third round of funding was carried by Sequoia Capital which  invested  a total amount of $60 million ($8 million in 2011 and $52 million in 2013) in WhatsApp Inc. This was the only source of income for the 50 staff members of WhatsApp. There wasn’t much expenditure involved in running the application; the primary cost included sending a verification code to the users. This is why WhatsApp waved off the $1 subscription fees. The strategy of the founders was to  position  the brand as a synonym for an instant messaging application. This required them to capitalize on  the network effect . Also Read:    Dropshipping Business Model | How To Start A Dropshipping Business? This strategy of creating a network first and money after proved to be fruitful. After two long years of being wooed by Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg, WhatsApp was acquired by Facebook on February  2014  for $19 billion and all the  employees were put to Facebook payrolls  including Koum, who is now a part of Facebook’s board. WhatsApp’s Revenue Model (Facebook’s Strategy) Facebook acquired WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion and this opened many new doors for the application. Even the answer to ‘How does WhatsApp make money?’ changed after the acquisition Facebook not only uses WhatsApp as a  user data generation factory  but also has introduced some really strategic plans for WhatsApp’s  revenue model . WhatsApp Business Facebook  had new plans for WhatsApp. The company launched  WhatsApp Business application  which lets users build their business profile and become a verified business on WhatsApp. The verified businesses can create their business profile along with certain important links to their website or facebook page, set up autoresponders, can even link their landline numbers with WhatsApp and can even integrate the WhatsApp for Business API with their product offering. The WhatsApp Business application is currently free to download and use for all businesses.  WhatsApp, however, makes money through WhatsApp for Business API .   WhatsApp for Business API The company extended its  business  functionality by launching its first revenue-earning product – WhatsApp Business API. Now, if you don’t know what an API is and how it works, I’d suggest you read our article on  API economy  first. WhatsApp API  lets the businesses integrate  WhatsApp for Business with their systems to reach out to customers through notifications and deal with their queries  automatically . To prevent ad spam, the company restricted the ability to send messages. Businesses can only send messages to people who have contacted them first, but the API will also help them programmatically send shipping confirmations, appointment reminders or event tickets to their customers. The company is already working successfully with clients like Booking.com, Wish, etc. Now, how does WhatsApp makes money through API? Also Read:    How Does PayPal Make Money? Paypal Revenue Model Well, WhatsApp has developed a really strategic revenue generation plan for this product. It charges businesses for slow replies. This means that the businesses will be able to respond to messages from users  for free for up to 24 hours , but will have to pay a  fee for every message sent after 24 hours . The charge is fixed but is different for different countries. The businesses can also choose to reply manually through their own tool or apps like Zendesk, MessageBird or Twilio. Now, most of you must be thinking that the businesses can always use their WhatsApp for Business application to reply late to the customer inquiries. No matter how simple this solution sounds, this technique doesn’t suite businesses dealing with millions of users (airline tickets, travel tickets, movie tickets, banks, etc.). Moreover, you cannot use API on any number already associated with WhatsApp. you need a fresh number to install the API. Payments WhatsApp has introduced a payments option (P2P payments) within the application for Indian users which will further boost its position in the market and will make it a preferred application for sending money (just like  Venmo  in the USA). This will further benefit WhatsApp business in the  company’s biggest market . During the recent F8 conference, Mark Zuckerberg also  disclosed his future plans  to release the WhatsApp payments feature to the rest of the world pretty soon. This will open gates to many more businesses relying on the platform the company capitalising on the  network effect . Future Revenue Earning Strategies It looks like copying Snapchat’s features wasn’t just to steal its consumer base, WhatsApp is now planning to copy its  revenue-earning strategies  as well. According to the  Economic Times , the company has plans to let businesses use the status feature, where text, photos, videos and animated GIFs can be shared for 24 hours, to advertise and promote their business.

 A PM’s Guide to Empowering Design and Engineering “You will hammer those nails into these widgets, Bob, and you will learn to enjoy it!” The Before Several years ago, at one of the previous places where I worked, we had major issues with product designer turnover and engineer engagement. Even though the company paid generously and had a good reputation, our software engineers would sit in sprint planning meetings, saying little and bolting out the door as soon as the meeting ended. New designers lost interest within a matter of months, and were usually gone before the year was up. One of the main causes for this team-wide dissatisfaction was our  product development  process, which at the time looked like this: The Executive team made new feature requests; PMs helped prioritize these ideas and fleshed these out into requirements. We then sent requirements to the designers, who then cranked out designs. Exec-approved designs then went to the engineering team, who built the feature according to spec and tested it. Once everything was working correctly, we launched it to users. Rinse and repeat. This approach (let’s call it the Product Development Assembly Line) created a few serious problems: Churn and delays during design and implementation : Because we didn’t loop in Engineering and  Design  together from the beginning of the project, we wandered far down paths that were too technically challenging to implement. For example, designers would spend weeks building pixel-perfect Invision prototypes, complete with animations and hover states, only to discover that their solution required a refactoring of the entire underlying data model. When that happened, we had to go back to the drawing board in order to come up with a more feasible solution, wasting precious time and slowing down the overall project. Total lack of investment in the features we worked on : With the assembly line approach, team members had no impact on the preceding step in the process. Designers had limited input on the requirements, and engineers had little say on either the requirements or the designs. Almost nobody (including PMs) bothered to contribute new feature ideas because we had little faith they’d make it into the roadmap. We treated our team members like pixel pushers and code monkeys, and unsurprisingly, they ended up not caring about the product. Uninformed feature suggestions : Without contributions from designers and engineers to the product roadmap, we often ended up working on the wrong set of features. At the time, our feature suggestions came largely from our Executive team as opposed to the people who spent the most time with our product and our users. Ensuing problems included delaying critical tech debt issues until our backend was on the verge of falling over, and failing to take user testing feedback into account when prioritizing features. Stunted professional development and personal growth : For many engineers and designers, progressing along their respective career tracks means participating more deeply in the product development process. For a senior engineer, this may include advocating for tech-driven initiatives like speeding up performance, while senior designers might want to emphasize recurring themes from user interviews. From this perspective, the Product Assembly Line does all team members a disservice; when everyone is just supposed to keep their heads down and stay in their lane, no one gets the experience they need to advance in their careers. Us 4 years ago The After Luckily, we eventually came to the realization that our product development approach was broken, and we overhauled it completely. Instead of ideas moving linearly from one functional role to the next, we adopted a much more collaborative approach. Let’s call this process the Product Development Loop. Cross-functional squads The foundation of the Product Development Loop is the the  Cross-functional Squad , which consists of a product manager, engineers, designers, and even business stakeholders (depending on the circumstances). Squads have an overarching goal that may vary from quarter to quarter — an example goal may be to increase monthly active users by 15%. All squad members play an active role in coming up with ideas for how to hit those goals, prioritizing what to work on first, and executing on high-impact ideas. (Best practices on this topic will be the subject of an entire standalone post, soon to come.) Feature Development Loops The process diagram for the Product Development Loop looks way more complicated than the Assembly Line, but it’s actually fairly simple. Basically, it just involves circling back with the cross-functional squad and checking after every major step in the process. In practice, the steps break down as follows: Project Kickoffs : Begin each project with a group discussion around the user problems you’re trying to solve and aligning on a high-level approach. Product Briefs & PRDs : PMs then flesh out more detailed user stories and requirements based off the approach, and then check in again with the squad. Wireframes, User Testing, & Technical Designs : From there, design and engineering work in parallel — designers build low-fidelity wireframes and conduct usability tests (if applicable), while engineers write a technical design document and solicit feedback from peers. Alignment : Cross-functional squad reviews wireframes, asks questions, and confirms that they satisfy the requirements without presenting a major technical challenge. High-Fidelity Designs & Implementation : Designers turn the wireframes into high-fidelity designs and present them in a developer-friendly format (think Invision Inspect or Zeplin), while engineers break down the technical design into discrete tasks and start working on the backend and preliminary frontend. Once high fidelity designs are complete, engineers can finish with styling and polish, collaborating closely with design to reduce iteration and churn. Pre-Launch Checks : Business stakeholders receive an end-to-end walkthrough of the feature, especially if their team has to use it post-launch (think a CMS or other internal tool). The cross-functional squad thoroughly dogfoods the feature, and everyone signs off on launch. Post-Launch Analysis : PMs work with data teams to make sure that reporting is in place and conducts analysis (both qualitative and quantitative) X days post-launch to measure impact. Debrief & Reflect : PM shares findings on impact with the rest of the squad and the team reflects on what areas of the feature are working well, and what areas can be improved. While this approach may not work for every team — some product teams may not have any designers, for instance — the general process and philosophy hold true for most organizations. At its core, the Product Development Loop seeks to give everyone on the team a seat at the table and a chance to make their voice heard. Epilogue A few months after we introduced the new process, employee turnover decreased and we noticed ourselves wasting less time on preventable churn in our work. In addition, we received a lot of great feedback from the team that they felt more ownership over the product as a whole. Us now (not an exaggeration) However, the Product Development Loop is not a perfect solution. There will always be times where an assumption turned out to be incorrect after we started working on a feature that required us to go back and change things. But as a whole, teams are a lot more forgiving of mistakes when they feel like they’re appreciated and doing meaningful work. And ultimately as a PM, you’re only as effective as your team, so the more you can empower them and make them feel invested in the outcome, the more successful you will be.

 Definition 
 Customer development is a four-step framework, originally identified by Steve Blank, to discover and validate that you have identified a need(s) that customers have, built the right product to satisfy that customer’s need(s), tested the correct methods for acquiring and converting customers, and deployed the right resources in the organization to meet the demand for the product. The framework provides a way to use a scientific approach to validate assumptions about your product and business. 
 The four steps of the framework are: 
 
 Customer discovery – Understand customers and their needs that you may be able to satisfy. 
 Customer validation – You have a product that will satisfy your customer’s needs. 
 Company creation – You determine whether your product will satisfy all the customers needs 
 Company building – You can grow your organization in order to support the demand for your product. 
 
 The Lean Startup approach combines customer development, which is helpful when you don’t know the problem, and agile development, which is helpful when you don’t know the solution. Both approaches provide ways to iteratively validate assumptions and learn through feedback. 
 The first step of customer development, customer discovery, is the part of the framework that plays the biggest part in Lean Startup, and has also been shortened to “discovery” by some in the agile community. Customer discovery helps you determine whether you understand the need you are trying to satisfy and whether you are satisfying the right need. 
 Customer discovery can be described as: 
1. Identify the need. 
 You may not always immediately know the actual need you are trying to satisfy. In some cases you start with a solution (product idea), at which point you need to work backward to figure out the need you are really trying to satisfy. 
 2. Hypothesize potential solutions. 
 Once you have an understanding of the true need, hypothesize a potential solution. If you were initially handed a solution to deliver, you can include that as a candidate, but you may find that the need you’re satisfying requires a completely different solution. 
 3. Identify assumptions. 
 Identify assumptions that are central to your hypothesized solution, including assumptions about 
 
 Business environment 
 Dependencies 
 Minimum requirements for a solution 
 Change management required 
 
 A helpful way to identify assumptions is to ask, “What must be true for this solution to be effective?” 
 4. Validate assumptions. 
 Talk to customers and gather data to validate your assumptions and test your solution. There are many different ways you can go about validating assumptions. 
 5. Start delivering. 
 Once you feel you have validated a sufficient number of assumptions, start delivering a minimal, yet viable, solution and get frequent feedback from your customers on whether the solution meets their needs. 
 6. Constantly reevaluate your solution. 
 Constantly reevaluate your solution to make sure it is still worthwhile based on new information that comes to light. Regularly ask whether you should commit to, transform, or kill the solution. 
 
 Also Known As 
 While not completely interchangeable as terms, close analogs to customer development at least with respect to intended outcome, are the ideas of discovery, and Lean UX. 
 
 Expected Benefits 
 The primary benefits to customer development is that it provides a team with an approach to take to validate assumptions, and it provides a way to go about determining whether the team is delivering the right thing. 
 
 Common Pitfalls 
 The most common pitfall related with customer development is that teams do not use it. Instead they fall in love with their product (the solution) without understanding which, if any, needs it satisfies. The result is a product without a market, or with a smaller market than anticipated and potential business issues. 
 
 When Applicable 
 Customer development was initially described in the context of technology startups, however the idea of building a shared understanding about customers and their needs prior to creating a product is applicable to all businesses and can even be applied to more established organizations that seek to introduce new products. 
 The approach to validating assumptions described as customer development can also be used in internal product situations, however the team in those cases knows there is a problem to solve, they just may not have clearly stated it or fully assessed whether the problem is worth solving. 
 In new product development settings, customer development is especially helpful to determine if there is a problem that needs to be solved and whether there is a product idea that can solve that problem in a valuable manner. 
 
 Origins 
 2005:  Steve Blank introduces the concept of customer development in his book  The Four Steps to the Epiphany . This book is based on actions he saw several start ups take to launch products. 
 2011:  Customer development sees a much broader audience when Eric Ries describes it as a key piece of Lean Startup (in conjunction with agile software development) in his book The Lean Startup

 Entrepreneur Guest 5 huge mistakes startups make when choosing board members 
 Eran Laniado   February 10, 2013 4:54 PM 
  .article-header  
 
 
  #article-masthead  
 
 
 
 
 This is a guest post by Eran Laniado, the managing director of  BMN! . 
 Has this happened to you? You needed to consult with a friend about an important matter, but when you finally met, you realized that he was hardly interested in your problem. Even worse, he half-heartedly gave you vague and remotely related advice. Could it get more frustrating? 
 Similarly, a CEO may feel that the board of directors does not help the company. She may be right — board meetings could be a waste of time; board members may be unproductive or burdensome; in the worst cases, lack of board cooperation may prevent a successful exit. Kevin Rose got an offer to sell Digg for $60 million a few years ago,  but his board rejected it . Digg was  sold for mere $500,000  back in July 2012. 
 Board ineffectiveness often stems from board nomination mistakes. Here are five big mistakes that are often made when choosing board members — and, maybe more importantly, tips on avoiding them. 
 1. Wrong People on the Board 
 Board members can be great resources who provide support, knowledge, and access to unique professional networks. Unfortunately, not all board members offer such value. 
 For example, some board members prioritize the interests of the investors or founders whom they represent far above those of the startup. 
 Scott Kurnik, an experienced entrepreneur and investor, advises  not to nominate to the board anyone reporting to the CEO . Interestingly enough, he also suggests putting the founder’s best friend on the board. 
 Additionally, one should be careful of five types of dysfunctional board members  as defined by Jack and Suzy Welch : The Do-Nothing; The White Flag (will do anything to avoid confrontation); The Cabalist (driven by personal agenda); The Meddler (dwells incessantly on details); and The Pontificator (only enjoys hearing himself speak). 
 How to avoid this mistake: 
 
 Carefully consider board nominees and ask for feedback from people who have worked with them. 
 Appoint at least one independent director, loyal to the company only. 
 
 2. Misalignment Regarding the Board’s Role 
 Boards of directors have many fiduciary and legal responsibilities. Still, boards often have additional roles, correlated with the venture’s stage. 
 At early-stage startups, members should support the management (without micro-managing it). For example, they may help guide product decisions or provide access to recruits, customers, and investors. Ideally, board members could also mentor founders. More established startups, however, may need a different type of assistance related to scaling sales, engineering, logistics, and other functions that no longer fit into a garage. 
 The above roles differ from those at publicly traded companies, where board members extensively monitor the firm’s performance and confirm that the management does not put its interests before the company’s (“the agent problem”). 
 Matt Blumberg, the CEO of Return Path, provides a useful summary of  what makes awesome board members . 
 How to avoid this mistake: 
 
 Check whether the candidate has board experience with firms of similar stages and needs. 
 Discuss with the candidate expectations of the board’s role and responsibilities. 
 
 3. A Homogeneous Board 
 It is important not to form a board of too similar profiles (e.g., all are engineers or all have similar VC backgrounds) and to  diversify your startup  to confirm that the various required skills are in place.  
 David Roth, the co-founder of AppFirst, described recently how  the need to balance the board  guided his startup’s decisions. 
 Aileen Lee of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers has an interesting argument, that  the next board member should be a woman , especially if women compose a significant portion of the venture’s users. 
 How to avoid this mistake: 
 
 List the skills and experience needed from the board (Product design? Customer acquisition? Partnerships? User experience? A great rolodex?). 
 Consider rejecting solid candidates whose skills and experience are common within the board in favor of candidates who possess the missing skills and attributes. 
 
 4. Too Many Board Members 
 An entrepreneur once complained, “My board keeps on growing.” VC-backed startups often encounter this problem when a new round of financing entitles investors to board seats. Sometimes, “observer rights” increase the number of attendants even more. 
 At some point, a board’s growth has diminishing returns. For a startup, a ten-person board will rarely be as engaged and helpful as a smaller one will. Further, the logistics (assembling everyone, arranging one-on-one time with the CEO before board meetings, etc.) become exponentially more complex. Fred Wilson from Union Square Ventures thinks a board of five members is ideal. He recommends  no more than 7 board members  (two founders, one to three VCs, and one to two other industry professionals). 
 How to avoid this mistake: 
 
 Negotiate the number of future board seats entitled with investors in the shareholders agreement. 
 Prefer nominees who will agree to leave the board when it grows or when their skill sets become less relevant. 
 Consider building a board of advisors to access additional experience without increasing the size of the board of directors. 
 
 5. Poor Organizational Fit 
 Some board relationship problems can harm the company severely. For example, board members who get involved in day-to-day decisions instead of supporting the management (or replacing the CEO, when necessary) can inhibit the CEO’s ability to lead. 
 Another problem occurs when board members accustomed to aggressive corporate cultures meet a CEO for whom “aggressive” equals “rude.” 
 Furthermore, pushy board members can cause CEOs to commit to unrealistic plans. It’s true that CEOs are responsible for their own decisions, but they can still be unduly pressured, especially when the board member is an investor (whom an inexperienced CEO may feel obligated to please). 
 Last, some board members may be professionally adept, but they do not show interest in mentoring the management, nor can they successfully interact with other members, bond, or build team spirit. 
 Steve Blank provides a painful example  of poor relationships between one of his ex-students and the chair of his startup. 
 How to avoid this mistake: 
 
 Check each candidate’s track record (tenure, reasons for leaving, relationships developed) as board member at other firms. 
 Replace board members who negatively impact the board’s internal relationships. This is not easy, but in extreme cases, it is necessary.

 What is a Distribution Channel? 
 Distribution channel refers to the network used to get a product from the manufacturer or creator to the end user. 
 When a distribution channel is “direct,” the manufacturer is selling directly to the end user without a middleman. When the distribution channel is “indirect,” the product changes hands several times before reaching the ultimate consumer. Intermediaries between the manufacturer and the consumer in an indirect distribution channel might include: 
 
 Wholesaler/distributor 
 Dealer 
 Retailer 
 Consultant  
 Manufacturer’s representative 
 Catalog 
 
 There might be just one intermediary; there might be many. 
 Direct vs. Indirect Distribution Channels 
 A company that sells directly to consumers through direct mail, a catalog of its own products, or its own ecommerce site represents a business that uses a direct distribution channel. For example, entrepreneurs who create and sell digital products that include workbooks, audio training, and online courses from their own websites are using a direct distribution channel. The digital products go directly from the creator to the customer. 
 On a larger scale, the beverage alcohol industry uses a multi-tier, indirect distribution channel. Distillers and wineries sell to distributors, who sell to retailers, who sell to consumers. But while wineries must use indirect distribution channels to get their wines into retail outlets where consumers can buy them, many also sell directly to consumers onsite at wineries. Using both approaches lets wineries reach a mass market through an indirect distribution channel and a smaller market through direct distribution via on-site retail operations that they own. 
 Distribution Channel Considerations 
 Businesses with products should ask a number of questions before determining a distribution program. Those questions include: 
 
 How does the end-user like to purchase these types of products? Does the consumer want to touch and examine the product or is it a product that the target audience likes to buy online?  
 What, if any, are the local, regional, or national regulations regarding the product category’s distribution channels?  
 Does the customer need personalized service? 
 Does the product itself need to be serviced? 
 Does the product need to be installed? 
 How is the product typically distributed and sold in your industry? 
 
 The distribution channel will have an impact on pricing. With indirect distribution, a product that goes from the manufacturer to a distributor before it goes to a retail outlet needs to be priced at wholesale so that both the distributor and retailer can mark up the price. With a multi-tier distribution channel, it looks like this: 
 
 The manufacturer’s customer is the distributor. 
 The distributor’s customer is the retailer. 
 The retailer’s customer is the consumer. 
 
 The manufacturer, distributor, and retailer all need to make money on that product. 
 The direct-to-consumer price is often the same as the price of a product that has been marked up several times through indirect distribution. Not offering a “direct to you” discount protects retailer relationships and offers the manufacturer or creator a higher profit on the product.

Design Systems Sprint 0: The Silver Bullet of Product Development.,https://medium.com/@marcintreder/design-systems-sprint-0-the-silver-bullet-of-product-development-8c0ed83bf00d,"Design Systems Sprint 0: The Silver Bullet of Product Development. Become a member Sign in Get started Design Systems Sprint 0: The Silver Bullet of Product Development. Marcin Treder Follow Apr 5, 2017     ·       7    min read A brief introduction:  I’m Marcin: a former UX manager and now co-founder and CEO at  UXPin — the full stack UX design platform . In this series of posts, I’m reporting on UXPin’s journey of creating our own design system. We’re starting by discussing the fundamentals of design systems (why? what?) and then we’re moving sprint, by sprint, through the entire process of building and maintaining a complete system. If you’re wondering why or how to build a design system, this series is for you. Like with every project at UXPin, our design system journey started with a series of user interviews. Between July and August 2016, I interviewed 40+ enterprise designers, developers and product leaders about their most pressing challenges. I wanted a clearer picture of where design and development was heading. Nothing paints a clearer vision of tomorrow than the pains of today. While these generative interviews are meant to inform our product roadmap, they also improve our own product development process. That’s an added benefit when you’re working on a platform for design and development teams. We can learn a ton from our own customers. This time, the end result led us to an unexpected revelation. Every interview revealed a problem we’d faced ourselves as we grew over the years. A problem so big and powerful that it can cripple product development at feisty startups, weigh down user experience at mid-size companies and completely prevent the scaling of design and development in enterprises. That problem is the lack of  design   consistency . The menace of every great product. Lack of design consistency: the biggest issue in product design? Design consistency was clearly a prevalent issue. And our interviewees were very vocal about what that meant for their teams and users: User confusion . Different patterns responsible for the same action confuse users, Slow design process.  Lack of reusable design assets slows down designers (‘everything is created from scratch’) Slow development.  Low number of fully reusable components bogs down development. Difficult onboarding.  Introducing new designers and developers to an undocumented ‘system’ is impossibly difficult. We wanted to learn more. We also wanted to validate the findings. So a couple of weeks after our interviews, we ran a large-scale survey on the state of enterprise design. Of the  3,175  respondents, 59% pointed at ‘improving UX consistency’ as the challenge they currently face in the UX process: Results of UXPin State of the Enterprise UX Survey The verdict was unmistakeable: the lack of consistency is constantly on designers’ minds — and rightfully so. Good design, by its nature, is systematic, yet growth of the team and of processes, unless meticulously managed, inevitably seem to lead to inconsistencies.  Karri Saarinen , Lead Designer on Airbnb’s design system, probably  put it best : “Software is often built by incredibly large teams of people. The challenge to create coherent experiences multiplies exponentially as more people are added to the mix. Over time, no matter how consistent or small a team is, different people will contribute new solutions and styles, causing experiences to diverge.” The more inconsistent the user experience, the slower product development becomes and vice versa. In my past experience as a UX manager in the enterprise, teams unable to identify design standards eventually default to building everything from scratch. And so the situation worsens. It’s a vicious cycle. Of course, users suffer the most. A Google Research  study from 2012  showed that users prefer simple interfaces, which seem familiar. They seek out experiences consistent with other experiences on the platform. We crave familiarity. Every new pattern responsible for the same action, or visual inconsistency, creates an unnecessary pause and an eventual burden. Consistency introduces feelings of safety and familiarity. Inconsistency creates chaos and confusion. Governing the chaos So how are these teams working to minimize inconsistencies? Participants of our study were very  consistent  in their answers: building and maintaining a design system. The enterprise segment (B2B products) of the design market seems to already be there: Results of UXPin State of the Enterprise UX Survey 69% of enterprises either have a design system or are currently working on one. Companies such as  Saleforce ,  IBM ,  Airbnb  and  Atlassian  lead the crowd with very mature implementations of living design systems. It certainly makes sense. At that size and scale, the problem of inconsistency is too painful and expensive to ignore. Deconstructing design systems So far in this short post I’ve mentioned the term ‘design system’ over 20 times. So what exactly is a design system? After all, it’s not a self-explanatory term. And it’s easily confused with style guides or UI pattern libraries. Let’s build our definition off why companies decide to build a design system in the first place. Design systems increase design consistency and code consistency (every reusable design pattern should have a corresponding reusable piece of code). With a design system, pieces of the system are reusable across multiple parts of a product and even across multiple products. By approaching product development with a LEGO-like process, we get more time back in our day to focus on bigger product problems. We minimize the redundant conversations and the one-off solutions. So if this is why companies build systems, than the following can serve as our working definition: A design system is the architectural core of a product(s) for ensuring design and code consistency and product development efficiency. It’s a little bit easier to understand if you’d take a look at the typical structure of a design system. What is a typical structure? To find out, we analyzed 39 publicly available design systems. Result of UXPin research Design systems are quite consistent in structure. We definitely see a lot of similarities across different systems. Typically, we have a library of interface patterns with corresponding code references, a definition of high level styling or structural elements (grid, colors, typography) and a set of design principles. If you’d like to further structurize it, here’s something I found really useful in explaining design systems to others: The design system is truly a gold standard — from the general building blocks of every piece of design, through the UI patterns, and building up the high-level rules defining the future of the product. A design system isn’t set in stone however. It should evolve with the product and always reflect the truth. Building and maintaining a design system is definitely a big challenge, but one worth facing. After all, it can break us out of the vicious cycle of unscalable design. To me, it sounded like a dream — one that we really needed to realize at UXPin. Design consistency at UXPin: why we really needed a design system Our own research hit us right in the face. We’ve tried to fight inconsistency in our interface with a set of design principles and rudimentary libraries, but we’d never moved into a full design system. While I wouldn’t call our experience fractured or completely inconsistent, we definitely had quirks which needed standardizing. Take these primary buttons: They’re visually different, yet hierarchically identical. Both buttons are responsible for the most important action in a given context. It might seem like a small thing, but great experiences are built out of small things. After doing some spot-checks of our own product and marking up the inconsistencies, we decided to do a complete audit as part of building out our design system. We needed to build a scaffolding for future product and team growth. Interestingly enough, a certain  modular  environment already existed in UXPin. Our development team moved to React.js over a year ago and the web development team started to build and maintain their Less files in a highly structured and modular way. UXPin Stylesheets Repository shows a good level of modularity Meanwhile, design needed to play some catch up. Together with development, we’d need to expand this approach for both disciplines to scale in harmony. The journey ahead By the time you’re reading these words, our Design Operations team (led by yours truly) is already multiple sprints ahead. It gives me time to reflect on what we’ve accomplished, so I can share all the hard lessons with you. Parts of the system already exist, parts are gradually being worked on. Here’s our current roadmap: In the next post, I’ll share how we created an inventory of UXPin design and how that helped create our design system. Stay tuned!

 Company culture is more important than ever. It’s not that company culture was ever unimportant, but it’s quickly proving to be a “must-have” rather than a “nice-to-have.” For the first time in history,  millennials have become the largest generational cohort in the U.S. workforce , with almost 54 million making up the labor force. Millennials aren’t from outer space, but they did grow up in a different setting from previous generations, which contributes to the shifting priorities that we’re seeing in the workforce today. Consider my grandfather, who presented me a gold watch that signified his 25 years of service at the same company. His generation and my parents’ generation had to navigate the labor force in the wake of the Great Depression and World War II. Therefore, I, along with the majority of my peers, was told that job security was the most important element when considering a career. Related:  Entrepreneur and CultureIQ Are Searching for the Top Company Cultures Millennials, by contrast, grew up in a time of financial prosperity and rapid technological advancements. A career means much more than a stable place to work for 25 years and employees are looking at company values, meaning, community, and culture. This leads us to today’s workplace landscape, in which HR leaders consider culture and engagement their  number-one challenge,  according to a  recent study by Deloitte University Press . It’s clear that in order to attract, retain and engage the modern workforce, we need to focus on company culture. It’s a tall order, and we should start by looking at what employees (millennials and non-millennials alike) value in their job. Here are three priorities of today’s workforce to consider when developing your company culture: Flexibility on the job According to a study by PWC,  employees of all generations are prioritizing flexibility in their jobs , whether that be in the form of scheduling, location or even office setup. In fact, for many employees, flexibility in a job is more important than compensation and promotion. As a father of two, I work from home from time to time so that I can attend school plays and soccer games. Providing this flexibility in my company allows me to be there for my family while running a growing business. My employees know they can do the same to achieve that balance in their life. Luckily, we live in an age of technology innovations, and there are plenty of solutions that help employees collaborate, learn and be productive, regardless of their hours or location. Related:  The 10 Company Culture Metrics You Should Be Tracking Right Now Professional development Like flexibility,  professional development is even more important  to millennials than financial rewards when selecting an employer. This means that you should think about the potential for advancement within your company and also how you are presenting job opportunities to prospective employees. There are many interesting professional development initiatives you can explore to make sure employees are learning and developing on the job, like connecting employees to MOOCs (massive open online courses), building out a mentorship program or promoting passion projects. Be good, do good Prospective and current employees care about your reputation as a company. This reputation encompasses your employer brand and also your company’s social responsibility efforts, such as corporate giving, volunteerism and sustainability. What your company does and says needs to align with what employees believe. A powerful example of making this part of your company culture is Whole Foods, who incorporates social responsibility as a core value:  “We serve and support our local and global communities .” However, it doesn’t need to be that drastic, and there are plenty of smaller things you can do as a company. For example, at my company  CultureIQ , we volunteered together as one of our monthly culture events. Some companies even allocate a designated amount of time for off-site volunteer activities. While millennials have brought these topics to the forefront of our minds, your company culture should be designed for and built by all employees. These priorities give you a place to start, but the strongest company cultures develop from input and feedback from employees.

What Is Jobs-to-be-Done?,https://jobs-to-be-done.com/what-is-jobs-to-be-done-fea59c8e39eb,"What Is Jobs-to-be-Done? - Jobs-to-be-Done + Outcome-Driven Innovation Sign in Get started History Frameworks Templates Podcasts Case Studies Leadership Fallacies What Is Jobs-to-be-Done? What is Jobs-to-be-Done Theory? What is a job-to-be-done? A desired outcome? It’s all explained in this article. Tony Ulwick Follow Feb 28, 2017     ·       11    min read JOBS-TO-BE-DONE is best defined as a perspective —  a lens through which you can observe markets, customers, needs, competitors, and customer segments differently, and by doing so, make innovation far more predictable and profitable. When Einstein engaged in his thought experiments, he pictured himself riding on a beam of light and traveling through the universe. From this perspective he was able to view the universe through a new lens, enabling him to see things in a different and meaningful way and to develop a theory that others could not. Similarly,  when you look at marketing and innovation through a  Jobs-to-be-Done lens , everything looks different : The unit of analysis is no longer the customer or the product, it’s the core functional “job” the customer is trying to get done. Markets aren’t defined around products, they are defined as groups of people trying to get a job done. Customers aren’t buyers, they are job executors. Needs aren’t vague, latent and unknowable, they are the metrics customers use to measure success when getting a job done. Competitors aren’t companies that make products like yours, they are any solution being used to get the job done. Customer segments aren’t based on demographics or psychographics, they are based on how customers struggle differently to get a job done. When a company thinks about a market from this perspective, it is much more likely to create and deliver extraordinary products and services. Why? While products come and go, the customer’s job-to-be-done is stable over time. With a focus on a stable unit of analysis, it becomes possible to define customer needs that are stable over time as well, giving companies unique, robust targets for value creation.  In short, jobs-to-be-done offers a new framework and lens through which a company can take its understanding of customer needs to the next level — and bring predictability to innovation. The first documented success achieved by a company applying this thinking was detailed in the 2002 Harvard Business Review article:  Turn Customer Input into Innovation . The article describes how in 1993 Cordis Corporation used this thinking to increase its angioplasty balloon market share from 1 percent to over 20 percent. Jobs-to-be-Done is best defined as a perspective — a lens through which customer needs can be effectively defined and communicated, making marketing more effective and innovation far more predictable. When looking at marketing and innovation through a jobs-to-be-done lens, a  theory  begins to emerge. JOBS-TO-BE-DONE THEORY is comprised of a group of principles or tenets that form a foundation for making marketing more effective and innovation more predictable by focusing on the customer’s job-to-be-done. The theory is based on the notion that people buy products and services to get a “job” done.  Jobs Theory goes on to say that by understanding in detail what that “job” entails, companies are far more likely to create and market solutions that will win in the marketplace. The core tenets of  Jobs-to-be-Done Theory  are summarized as follows: People buy products and services to get a “job” done. Jobs are functional, with emotional and social components. A Job-to-be-Done is stable over time. A Job-to-be-Done is solution agnostic. Success comes from making the “job”, rather than the product or the customer, the unit of analysis. A deep understanding of the customer’s “job” makes marketing more effective and innovation far more predictable. People want products and services that wil help them get a job done better and/or more cheaply People seek out products and services that enable them to get the entire job done on a single platform Customer needs, when tied to the job-to-be-done, make innovation predictable To learn more about these tenets, see the Medium article,  The Core Tenets of Jobs-to-be-Done Theory . For a more comprehensive understanding of the theory and its evolution, see  What Customers Want  (2005), the first book written on this subject. In order to study a job-to-be-done, the job must be correctly defined: A JOB-TO-BE-DONE is a statement that describes, with precision, what a group of people are trying to achieve or accomplish in a given situation. A job-to-be-done could be a task that people are trying to accomplish, a goal or objective they are trying to achieve, a problem they are trying to resolve, something they are trying to avoid, or anything else they are trying to accomplish. A job statement is written as [verb] + [object of the verb] + [contextual clarifier] (optionally). For example, pass on life lessons to children, repair a torn rotator cuff and prevent a shooter from entering a school, are all jobs-to-be-done. To gain a deep understanding of the customer’s job-to-be-done, a company must be able to discover the customer’s “needs” associated with getting that job done. When looking at a market through a jobs-to-be-done lens, customer needs can be discovered by studying the customer’s core functional job  as a process . Tactically, the core functional job can be broken down into steps using what we call a job map as described in the 2008 Harvard Business Review article,  The Customer-Centered Innovation Map . With the job map in place, companies can then seek to discover the metrics customers use to measure success as they try to get each step in the job done.  These metrics are the perfect way to think about and define the customer’s “needs.”  These need statements, which we call “desired outcomes,” bring predictability to innovation. A DESIRED OUTCOME STATEMENT is a specially constructed need statement that has a unique set of characteristics: desired outcomes are devoid of solutions, stable over time, measureable, controllable, structured for reliable prioritization in a quantitative customer survey, and are   tied to the underlying process (or job) the customer is trying to get done  (see the Medium article,  Inventing the Perfect Customer Need Statement  and the 2008 MIT Sloan article,  Giving Customers a Fair Hearing ). Since the customer’s job-to-be-done is stable over time, the customer’s needs, when defined as desired outcome statements, are also stable over time. (See the Medium article,  Define Customer Needs As Constants ). With a stable set of “needs” in hand, a company is able to: Quantify which needs are underserved and overserved. Discover segments of customers with different unmet needs. Use the metrics as a baseline against which they can test product ideas and concepts  before they are developed . Knowing which product or service concept will get the job done best early in the product planning stages ( prior to development),  is the key to predictable and profitable innovation. This case study  shows how Bosch applied Jobs Theory to  product innovation . This case study  shows how Arm & Hammer applied Jobs Theory to  marketing innovation . This case study  shows how AMO applied Jobs Theory to  service innovation . Jobs-to-be-Done Theory is applicable along many fronts To explain how to put Jobs-to-be-Done Theory into practice, let’s start by asking, “Who are the potential users of Jobs-to-be-Done Theory and what are the jobs they are trying to get done?” Four jobs are of particular interest: (1) market selection (deciding what markets to enter), (2) product planning (deciding what products to create), (3) product development (deciding how to best design a product), and (4) buying process (deciding how to improve the customer’s buying process). 1. Market Selection: deciding what markets to enter.  First, Jobs-to-be-Done Theory is being embraced by entrepreneurs in startups and managers in corporations and corporate venturing units who are trying to discover, evaluate and select markets that are attractive for them to enter/pursue. When looking through a jobs-to-be-done lens, a market is defined as a group of people (job executors) and the job they are trying to get done. As entrepreneurs and managers engage in the market discovery and selection process, they start by trying to discover a number of unique jobs that job executors are struggling to get done. Their goal is to discover and define the jobs at a level of abstraction that makes the job a uniquely attractive target. To learn how to define jobs at the right level of abstraction, see  JOBS TO BE DONE: Theory to Practice  (Ulwick, 2016). Once a number of markets are identified, the next step in the market selection process is to determine which is the most attractive to pursue. A job, for example, that is executed by many people, frequently, and is highly underserved would be a more attractive target than one that is executed by fewer people, infrequently and is already appropriately served. Strategyn’s clients use a market evaluation tool that includes 42 criteria to help make the market selection decision (see Figure 2). This worksheet can be downloaded from  Strategyn’s home page . Figure 2: Jobs-to-be-Done Market Evaluation and Selection Template 2. Product Planning: deciding what products to create.  Second, Jobs-to-be-Done Theory has been embraced by product, marketing and innovation managers in established companies who are trying to grow and expand their core markets. Their goals are to typically (i) create a value proposition that resonates with customers, (ii) improve existing products, and (iii) conceptualize altogether new products that will address core or adjacent market opportunities. These activities, executed by the product planner, comprise the innovation process. To apply Jobs-to-be-Done Theory to assist in marketing and innovation, Strategyn developed  Outcome-Driven Innovation® (ODI).  The  innovation process  originated in 1991 and has been simplified and improved through hundreds of applications within Fortune 500 companies since. Strategyn introduced ODI to Clayton Christensen in 1999. Six successes arising from the process are described in detail in a book recently released,  JOBS TO BE DONE: Theory to Practice  (Ulwick, 2016). The ODI process is comprised of the following 6 steps (Figure 3): Figure 3: The Outcome-Driven Innovation Process While the first step overlaps a step in the market selection process (market discovery and definition) the remaining steps in the process are different and so are the tools required to execute them. To win at innovation a company must know what a customer need is, what the customer’s needs are, which are unmet and if segments of customers exist with unique sets of unmet needs. With the target well defined, creating a winning solution becomes far more likely. ODI reveals the required insights using unconventional qualitative and quantitative market research techniques. The process uniquely employs predictive data and a sophisticated market segmentation methodology that helps companies discover and prioritize hidden market opportunities. Strategyn has developed a comprehensive set of tools to help its clients execute each step in the process. Additional information on the ODI  innovation process  can be found here. 3. Product Development: deciding how to best design a product.  The third application involves developers and UI and UX designers who are trying to develop products that have been approved for development (their job-to-be-done). These developers may work in lean or agile environments. Their goal is to ensure that the products they create and the code they write not only delivers on the product specifications, but also guarantees a positive user experience. Those trying to apply Jobs-to-be-Done Theory to the product development process typically have the benefit of knowing what product they are trying to create: the product is already conceptualized and defined as part of the innovation process. What developers and UI and UX designers struggle with are design issues and understanding the customer’s needs that relate to what we call consumption chain jobs, such as learning how to use and interfacing with the product (see Figure 4). Figure 4: Consumption Chain Jobs and Outcomes As an extension of the ODI process, our clients apply steps 2 and 3 of the ODI process (outcome gathering and prioritization) to better understand the outcomes of users as they learn how to use, interface with the product and engage in the remaining consumption chain jobs that must be considered in the design phase. We have collected outcomes in all consumption chain jobs multiple times over the years. If a company uses ODI for the innovation process, developers will have the prioritized outcomes associated with the core functional job. These inputs are needed for development/design as well. These insights can then be communicated to developers or UX and UI designers in the following Job/Outcome Story format: Figure 1: The Job/Outcome Story for Developers/Designers If a developer does not have access to the customer outcomes associated with the core functional job-to-be-done, then they tend to want to execute the innovation process in conjunction with the development process — learning more about the required product function as they create the product. Combining the development process with the innovation process creates confusion when using and implementing Jobs-to-be-Done Theory. A product concept should be well defined and proven to win in the marketplace  before  it is approved for development. The ODI process makes this possible. 4. Buying Process: deciding how to improve the customer’s buying process.  The forth application of the theory involves marketing team members who are trying to understand the process that customer’s go through when buying a product so they can enhance the customer’s buying experience. Confusion over Jobs-to-be-Done theory results from thinking that understanding the customer purchase decision will somehow inform the innovation and development processes as well, but it does not. The purchase “process” is an altogether unique job the customer is trying to get done, and is best studied as a separate job. We have studied the purchase “job” on a number of occasions over the years, most recently with Harte Hanks where we studied customers of retailers who were engaged in the purchase process. The results of that work can be seen in this article:  Can Bricks and Mortar Compete With On-Line Retailing . The article shows that the purchase process involves the customer working to understand the problem they are trying to solve and then researching and evaluating possible solutions, selecting the best solution, deciding where to buy it, and finally, engaging in the physical transaction required to acquire the product. Gaining customer insights across this job at the desired outcome level can lead to improvements in the customer’s purchase experience. While each of these four jobs is clearly different, they can all benefit from Jobs-to-be-Done Theory. It’s just a matter of picking the right tool for the job.

Alan Klement Follow Oct 9, 2016     ·       12    min read The designers at intercom (intercom.com) use this illustration to show what is, and isn’t, important to customers. Upgrade your user, not your product. Don’t build better cameras — build better photographers. — Kathy Sierra Ten thousand years ago, we were hunter gatherers and used our feet to roam the earth. Today, we have fast food restaurants and autonomous cars. Why did we change? Because we have an intrinsic desire to evolve ourselves. We do this by remaking and adapting to the world around us. The desire to evolve is in our DNA. It’s what makes us human. Moreover, we do this evolution with purpose. We purposefully use the arts to evolve ourselves emotionally; the sciences to evolve ourselves intellectually; and engineering to evolve how we interact with the world. Purposeful evolution is why we are different from animals: A bear trying to catch food by the river may think,  I wish fishing could be made better, faster, or easier . But only a human will think,  Fishing is no good. If I could transform that lagoon over there into a place where I can breed fish, then I’d never have to go fishing again . The bear thinks only about  what is . Today, it may come up with a better, faster, or easier way to fish. But tomorrow, it is still a bear that fishes. The human, on the other hand, thinks about  what ought to be . Today, she fishes, but tomorrow that can change. If she could figure out a way to no longer fish, then she can focus on improving herself in other ways — like building a hut so she could move out of that dank cave. The bear does not think about evolving itself and its world. It never has a Job to be Done. The human, on the other hand, does think about evolving herself. And every time she begins the process of evolving herself, she has a Job to be Done. Improve your life-situation; become more than you are Charles Revson, founder of Revlon, perfectly encapsulates a JTBD when he said: In the factory we make cosmetics; in the drugstore we sell hope. With these words, Revson marks the difference between what customers buy, and why they buy it. This thinking was also carried over into Revlon’s advertising. In 1952, Revlon’s breakout advertising campaign was Fire and Ice (figure 4). The advertising campaign makes it clear: Revlon isn’t selling a product, it’s selling a “new me.” In fact, there’s barely any mention of any product. One whole page is a check list of provocative questions; the other features a picture of model Dorian Leigh. Only on further investigation do you notice the lipstick and nail polish at the bottom of the page. Figure 4. What is being sold here — lipstick and nail polish or a “new me”? A Job to be Done is neither found nor spontaneously created. Rather, it is designed. The checklist of provocative questions such as, “Have you ever wanted to wear an ankle bracelet?” exists to help customers imagine (i.e., design) what new me will be created when they buy Revlon’s products. Then there’s the picture of Dorian Leigh. Upon seeing that, consumers continue to design a new version of myself in my mind. For some, the new me looks like her. For others, the new me is with her. Whatever the case, if this new me is something I want, I begin desiring it. In other words, I have a Job to be Done. Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones. — Herbert A. Simon A Job to be Done defined Jobs to be Done is a theory of consumer action. It describes  the mechanisms  that cause a consumer to adopt an innovation. The theory states that markets grow, evolve, and renew whenever customers have a Job to be Done, and then buy a product to complete it (get the Job Done). This makes a Job to be Done a process: it starts, it runs, and it ends. The key difference, however, is that a JTBD describes how a customer changes or wishes to change. With this in mind, we define a JTBD as follows: A Job to be Done is the process a consumer goes through whenever she aims to change her existing life-situation into a preferred one, but cannot because there are constraints that stop her. Products enable customers to get a Job Done FIGURE 6. SAMUEL HULICK USES THIS ILLUSTRATION TO SHOW HOW CUSTOMERS USE PRODUCTS TO DESIGN A “NEW ME”. Humans are limited in our abilities. We can’t create a new me by ourselves. A snap of our fingers cannot create a world where a morning commute is an enjoyable experience. Realizing such a change requires innovation on the part of oneself or someone else. Progress can only happen when we attach and integrate new ideas and new products into our lives. An example of constructing (i.e., designing) a Job to be Done comes from a research project I led to understand what Job or Jobs customers were hoping to get Done (i.e., what new me customers were hoping to create) with a project management software. Here is a synopsis of one interview. Notice how the hero of our story comes to realize a new me is possible, and how he must attach a product to himself to attain that new me. Andreas began a business around medical tourism. Over time, he grew his business to include five employees. One day, he was out with a friend of his, Jamie, at a coffee shop. During their conversation, Jamie mentioned a product called Basecamp to Andreas. Andreas had never heard of it. He was curious to learn more. Jamie explained to Andreas that Basecamp was a project management tool that helped small businesses become better at organizing themselves. Andreas was surprised by this. He knew about complicated project management products like Microsoft Project, but those were for big companies only, not smaller ones like his. Currently, Andreas was using Google Sheets, Google Docs, and e-mail to run his company. He just assumed that, well, that’s how companies his size operated. Jamie further explained that Basecamp was made specifically to help companies his size. As Jamie spoke, Andreas’s mind began racing:  Basecamp could help my company stay organized as it adds more customers and employees . Up until this point, he had just assumed that his company had hit its growth limit. Andreas and Jamie enjoyed their coffee and parted ways. During his train ride home, Andreas looked up Basecamp on his mobile device. He also learned about and investigated similar products to Basecamp. In the end, he decided to go with Basecamp. He signed up for it, began using it, and grew his company beyond five employees for the first time. This is what a Job to be Done looks like. A consumer goes along his life as he’s come to know it. Then things change. He is presented with an opportunity for self-betterment — that is, make changes so he can grow. When or if he finds a product that helps him realize that growth opportunity, he can evolve to that better version of himself he had imagined. Besides demonstrating a JTBD well, Andreas’s story also demonstrates that creating a new me (i.e., having a JTBD) is a  process . It’s not something that consumers have; it’s something consumers participate in. That’s why it’s called a Job to be Done. A comparable example is falling in love. Falling in love isn’t something you have; it’s something you participate in. And just as you can’t complete the fall-in-love process by yourself, a customer can’t complete a JTBD by himself. He needs a product to help him design, construct, and complete it. What isn’t a Job to be Done Figure 6. Don Norman’s 1988 Book,  The Design Of Everyday Things , features Activity-Centered-Design and the Seven stages of Actions seen here. This theory formed the basis of methods such as Task Analysis and Human-computer Interaction. While many of us have been applying Customer Jobs for a while — Rick Pedi and John Palmer have been developing Customer Jobs since the 1990s — it has gained popularity only recently. And like so many things that spread quickly, many people have distorted and misinterpreted it. The biggest mistake I see is thinking of a Job to be Done as an activity or task . Examples include  store and retrieve music  or  listen to music . These are not Jobs; rather, they are tasks and activities — which means they describe how you use a product or what you do with it. For example, music streaming products such as Pandora and Spotify were designed specifically so customers didn’t have to  store and retrieve music  like when they used CDs or MP3s. As far as  listen to music , that is a broad activity that varies wildly depending on the context. Someone  listening to music  so he can maintain his motivation during a workout is engaging in a very different activity than someone going to the opera to  listen to music . I gave a business partner a watch to show my appreciation for his hard work. What was my Job to be Done? How can my JTBD be functional if I never directly use it? Besides, there are already brilliant design methods out there to help you design for tasks and activities. Examples include activity theory, Don Norman’s activity-centered design (figure 6), and human-computer interaction (HCI). If you want to learn more about how to design for activities, go there. There are not different types of Jobs.  Another common mistake is to think that there are types of Jobs. In particular, some may think there are emotional, function, and social Jobs. I’ll describe why it’s a bad idea from both a practical and theoretical perspective. Practically , you’ll be more successful when you think of every Customer Job as unique. We’ve learned that while many Jobs share the same core emotional desires (e.g., belonging, self-expression, control, etc.), each Job is a unique combination of these desires. That is why each product should deliver on these core emotional desires in its own way. A good example is Facebook. A lot of people use Facebook because it taps into desires such as control, self-expression, and belonging — but it does so in its own unique way. So instead of saying that there are types of Jobs, you’ll be much better off thinking that each Job is unique. Theoretically  — that is, from an ontological and epistemological perspective — Customer Jobs are design (artificial) problems, not natural problems. Natural problems are falsifiable. This means they can be objectively measured and determined as either true or false: Q: Is argon (Ar) a noble gas? A: If under conditions X it reacts, then yes; otherwise, no. Design problems, on the other hand, are not falsifiable and cannot be objectively measured: Q: Is this painting any good? Person 1: “Yes.” Person 2: “No.” With respect to Jobs, then, no objective test can be created to say, “This is a social Job. That is not a social Job.” If I buy a Ferrari to impress other people, is it a “social” Job because I reference other people? Or should we rephrase it as an insecurity, making it a “personal” or “emotional” Job? And because there’s no way to objectively define each type of Job, every person on the team will have his or her own opinion of what type of Job it should be. Moreover, even if/when you do get consensus, so what? Isn’t knowing that I bought a Ferrari because I want to “fit in” good enough? What do you gain by labeling it a social or personal Job? I’ll tell you: absolutely nothing. Take it from me, don’t waste your time trying to dissect Jobs into different types. It’s about as productive as trying to answer, “How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?” Is it a Customer Job? Does it describe a “new” me or something else?  When presented with a possible description of a Customer Job, the best framework of thinking I can offer you is the decision tree in figure 7. Figure 7. is it a customer job or something else? Keep in mind that a Job to be Done describe the “better me.” It answers the question, “How are you better since you started using [product]?” Renowned psychologist Albert Bandura described humans as “proactive, aspiring organisms”. Customer Jobs carries this idea into markets, making the claim that we buy and use things to improve ourselves, to make progress. If you’re not describing a Customer Job in terms of progress, you’re probably describing something else. Where does JTBD theory come from? The greatest — and most helpful — theories are not created by one person but are the result of many people over a long period (figure 8). This is certainly the case with JTBD. Its principles have emerged from the work of a long lineage of researchers and innovators. Here are the most notable. Figure 8. A genealogy of customer jobs. Joseph Schumpeter and creative destruction.  The roots of JTBD go back at least seventy-five years to Joseph Schumpeter and his introduction of creative destruction. Schumpeter observed that new innovations steal customers from incumbent offerings and then eventually go on to replace them. At one time, horses and ships were our primary methods of personal transportation. Eventually, trains replaced horses, but then cars and airplanes replaced those trains and ships. Customer Jobs incorporates Schumpeter’s insights as it seeks to understand why customers pick one way of doing things over another. Yes, innovators create new solutions, but the wheels of creative destruction turn only through the interaction between customers and innovators. Customer Jobs also incorporates another one of Schumpeter’s brilliant insights that is almost always overlooked. Schumpeter argued that competition should not be measured only among products of the same “type.” He insisted that competition can come from anywhere. You might think you’re alone in a market or have market superiority, but some competitor unknown to you could be stealing away your customers. Your only sign that something is wrong is decreasing sales. In chapter 8, we take a close look at Customer Jobs, creative destruction, and competition. W. Edwards Deming and systems thinking.  Schumpeter’s influence on Customer Jobs is restricted mostly to factors of market dynamics and competition; however, W. Edwards Deming has influenced Customer Jobs the most. Those who are familiar with his nearly sixty years of contribution to theories of management and innovation will recognize his fingerprints throughout this book. Deming’s most notable influence comes from his development of systems thinking, which I discuss in chapter 13. Throughout Deming’s career, he frequently reminded businesses that producers and customers are connected by systems: The customer and producer must work together as a system. The consumer is the most important part of the production line. Deming often challenged companies to remember creative destruction. He impressed on business leadership that simply making a product better and better — improving what already exists — wasn’t enough. Sooner or later, someone will invent something new. He would tell businesses the following: Makers of vacuum tubes improved year by year the power of vacuum tubes. Customers were happy. But then transistor radios came along. Happy customers of vacuum tubes deserted vacuum tubes and ran for the pocket radio. A dissatisfied customer does not complain; he just switches. Deming understood that improving products of today continually isn’t enough: “We must keep asking, what new product or service would help our customers more? What will we be making five years from now? Ten years from now?” For Deming, the process of innovation should never stop.11 Psychology.  On the psychology front, you’ll run into influences from Gary Klein, Amos Tversky, Daniel Kahneman, George Loewenstein, and Ann Graybiel. These are psychologists and scientists whose work forms the foundations of behavioral economics and naturalistic decision making (NDM). Their work helps us understand how and why customers don’t make rational decisions when buying and using products, are inconsistent in their opinions of products, and don’t always act in their best interest. Customer Jobs understands that if you want to make a great product and to develop a message that connects with customers, you have to understand the emotional forces that shape their motivation. Bringing it all together.  Then, you arrive at John B. Palmer, Rick Pedi, and Bob Moesta. In the 1990s, they began working together to combine their respective experiences into the first Customer Jobs principles. They are the ones who came up with the idea and language that customers have “Jobs” that they are trying to get “Done.” Then, you get to me and this book. John, Rick, and Bob have personally influenced me more than I could ever express. Last but certainly not least, the entire JTBD community has had a tremendous influence on me. Without their application of and experience with JTBD, this book would not have been possible. Want to make progress with learning and applying JTBD theory?

 A social media marketing strategy is a summary of everything you plan to do and hope to achieve on social media. It guides your actions and lets you know whether you’re succeeding or failing. Every post, reply, like, and comment should serve a purpose. 
 The more specific your strategy is, the more effective the execution will be. Keep it concise. Don’t make your plan so lofty and broad that it’s unattainable or impossible to measure. 
 In this post, we’ll walk you through an eight-step plan to create a winning social media marketing plan of your own. 
 Bonus:  Get a free social media strategy template   to quickly and easily plan your own strategy. Also use it to track results and present the plan to your boss, teammates, and clients. 
 
 How to create a social media strategy 
 Step 1. Set social media marketing goals that align to business objectives 
 Set S.M.A.R.T. goals 
 The first step to creating a winning strategy is to establish your objectives and goals. Without goals, you have no way to measure success or  return on investment (ROI) . 
 Each of your goals should be: 
 
 Specific 
 Measurable 
 Attainable 
 Relevant 
 Time-bound 
 
 This is the  S.M.A.R.T. goal framework . It will guide your actions and ensure they lead to real business results. 
 Track meaningful metrics 
 Vanity metrics  like retweets and likes are easy to track, but it’s hard to prove their real value. Instead, focus instead on targets such as leads generated, web referrals, and conversion rate. 
 For inspiration, take a look at these  19 essential social media metrics . 
 You may want to track different goals for different channels, or even different uses of each channel. For example,  Benefit Cosmetics drives brand awareness  with its paid social campaigns, but measures acquisition and engagement for organic social posts.

   CAPTION THIS!???????????? Best answers might just win a #benefit package! #hoola A post shared by   Benefit Cosmetics US  (@benefitcosmetics) on  Mar 11, 2019 at 8:40pm PDT Make sure to align your social media goals with your overall marketing strategy. This will make it easier for you to show the value of your work and get executive buy-in and investment. Start developing your social media marketing plan by writing down at least three goals for social media. Step 2. Learn everything you can about your audience Create audience personas Knowing who your audience—and ideal customer—is and what they want to see on social is key to creating content that they will like, comment on, and share. It’s also critical if you want to turn social media followers into customers for your business. Try  creating audience/buyer personas . These allow you to think of your potential fans, followers, and customers as real people with real wants and needs. And that will allow you to think more clearly about what to offer them. Gather real-world data Don’t make assumptions. Think Facebook is a better network for reaching Baby Boomers than Millennials? Well, the numbers show that Millennials still outnumber Boomers on the platform. Social media analytics can also provide a ton of valuable information about who your followers are, where they live, which languages they speak, and how they interact with your brand on social. These insights allow you to refine your strategy and better target your social ads. Jugnoo, an Uber-like service for auto-rickshaws in India, used Facebook Analytics to learn that  90 percent of their users who referred other customers  were between 18- and 34-years-old, and 65 percent of that group was using Android. They used that information to target their ads, resulting in a 40 percent lower cost per referral. Check out our  guide to using social media analytics and the tools you need to track them . Step 3. Research the competition Odds are, your competitors are already using social media—and that means you can learn from what they’re already doing. Conduct a competitive analysis A  competitive analysis  allows you to understand who the competition is and what they’re doing well (and not so well). You’ll get a good sense of what’s expected in your industry, which will help you set social media targets of your own. This analysis will also help you spot opportunities. For example, maybe one of your competitors is dominant on Facebook, but has put little effort into Twitter or Instagram. You might want to focus on the networks where your audience is underserved, rather than trying to win fans away from a dominant player. Engage in social listening Social listening  is another way to keep an eye on the competition. Here’s how to use Hootsuite streams for social listening and monitoring competitors: As you track competitor accounts and relevant industry keywords, you may notice shifts in the way these channels are used. Or, you might spot a specific post or campaign that really hits the mark—or totally bombs. Keep an eye on this information and use to it evaluate your own goals and plans. Step 4. Conduct a social media audit Examine your current efforts If you’re already using social media tools, you need to take a step back and look at what you’ve already done and accomplished. Ask yourself the following questions: 
 What’s working, and what’s not? 
 Who is connecting with you on social? 
 Which networks does your target audience use? 
 How does your social media presence compare to that of your competitors? 
 Once you gather all this information in one place, you’ll have a good starting point for planning how to improve your results. We’ve created a  social media audit template  that you can follow for each step of the process.   Your audit should give you a clear picture of what purpose each of your social accounts serves. If the purpose of an account isn’t clear, think about whether it’s worth keeping. To help you decide, ask yourself the following questions: 
 Is my audience here? 
 If so, how are they using this platform? 
 Can I use this account to help achieve meaningful business goals 
 Asking these tough questions will help keep your strategy on track and focused. Look for impostor accounts During the audit you may discover fraudulent accounts using your business name or the names of your products. These imposters can be harmful to your brand, never mind capturing followers that should be yours. Report them. You may want to get your  Facebook  and  Twitter accounts verified  to ensure your fans and followers know they are dealing with the real you. Step 5. Set up accounts and improve existing profiles Determine which networks to use (and how to use them) As you decide which social channels to use, you will also need to define your strategy for each network. For example, Benefit Cosmetics’ social media manager, Angela Purcaro,  told eMarketer : “For our makeup tutorials … we’re all about Snapchat and Instagram Stories. Twitter, on the other hand, is designated for customer service.” For reference, here’s how other small and medium-sized businesses are using social tools to  communicate with customers . Notice that Facebook and Instagram outrank even email for this purpose. It’s a good exercise to create mission statements for each network. These one-sentence declarations will help you focus on a very specific goal for each account on each social network. Example:  “We will use Facebook advertising to target a specific audience in order to increase sales.”  One more:  “We will use Instagram for promoting and sharing our company culture to help with recruitment and employee advocacy.” If you can’t create a solid mission statement for a particular social network, you may want to reconsider whether that network is worth it. Set up (and optimize) your accounts Once you’ve decided which networks to focus on, it’s time to create your profiles—or improve existing profiles so they align with your strategic plan. 
 Make sure you fill out all profile fields 
 Use keywords people will use to search for your business 
 Use images that are correctly sized for each network 
 Here’s a quick overview of how to get your social media profiles into tip-top shape: We’ve also got step-by-step guides for each network to walk you through the process: 
 Create a Facebook business page 
 Create an Instagram business account 
 Create a Twitter business account 
 Create a Snapchat account 
 Create a LinkedIn Company Page 
 Create a Pinterest business account 
 Create a YouTube channel 
 Create a WeChat business account 
 Don’t let this list overwhelm you. Remember, it’s better to use fewer channels well than to stretch yourself thin trying to maintain a presence on every network.

 Step 6. Find inspiration While it’s important that your brand be unique, you can still draw inspiration from other businesses that are great on social . Social network success stories You can usually find these on the business section of the social network’s website. ( Here’s Facebook’s , for example.) These case studies can offer valuable insights you can apply to your own goals for each social network. Award-winning accounts and campaigns You could also check out the winners of  The Facebook Awards  or  The Shorty Awards  for examples of brands that are at the top of their social media game. Your favorite brands on social media. Who do you enjoy following on social media? What do they do that compels people to engage and share their content? National Geographic, for example, is one of the best on Instagram, combining stunning visuals with compelling captions.

A post shared by   National Geographic  (@natgeo) on  Mar 10, 2019 at 6:03pm PDT Then there’s Shopify. The ecommerce brand uses Facebook to sell themselves by showcasing customer stories and case studies. And IKEA is a great example of superior customer service on Twitter. They use their 280 characters to solve problems and answer questions—often with a bit of humor.

 — IKEAIESupport (@IKEAIESupport)  March 12, 2019 Notice that each of these accounts has a consistent voice, tone, and style. Consistency is key to helping your followers understand what to expect from your brand. They’ll know why they should continue to follow you and what value they will get from doing so. It also helps keep your branding consistent even when you have multiple people working on your social team. For more on this, read our  guide on establishing a compelling brand ‘voice’ on social media . Ask your followers Consumers can also offer social media inspiration. What are your target customers talking about online? What can you learn about their wants and needs? If you have existing social channels, you could also ask your existing followers what they want from you. Just make sure that you follow through and deliver what they ask for. Step 7. Create a social media content calendar Sharing great content is essential, of course, but it’s equally important to have a plan in place for when you’ll share content to get the maximum impact. Your  social media content calendar  also needs to account for the time you’ll spend interacting with the audience (although you need to allow for some spontaneous engagement as well). Create a posting schedule Your social media content calendar lists the dates and times at which you will publish types of content on each channel. It’s the perfect place to plan all of your social media activities—from images and link sharing to blog posts and videos. It includes both your day-to-day posting and content for social media campaigns. Your calendar ensures your posts are spaced out appropriately and  published at the optimal times . Plot your content mix Make sure your calendar reflects the mission statement you’ve assigned to each social profile, so that everything you post is working to support your business goals. For example, you might decide that: 
 50 percent of content will drive traffic back to your blog 
 25 percent of content will be  curated from other sources 
 20 percent of content will support enterprise goals (selling, lead generation, etc.) 
 5 percent of content will be about HR and company culture 
 Placing these different post types in your content calendar will help ensure you maintain the ratio you’ve planned. If you’re starting from scratch and you’re simply not sure what types of content to post, try the 80-20 rule: 
 80 percent of your posts should inform, educate, or entertain your audience 
 20 percent can directly promote your brand. 
 You could also try the social media rule of thirds: 
 One-third of your social content promotes your business, converts readers, and generates profit. 
 One-third of your social content shares ideas and stories from thought leaders in your industry or like-minded businesses. 
 One-third of your social content involves personal interactions with your audience. 
 Once you have your calendar set, use scheduling tools or  bulk scheduling  to prepare your messaging in advance rather than updating constantly throughout the day. This allows you to craft the language and format of your posts rather than writing them on the fly whenever you have time. Step 8. Test, evaluate, and adjust your strategy Your social media strategy is a hugely important document for your business, and you can’t assume you’ll get it exactly right on the first try. As you start to implement your plan and track your results, you may find that some strategies don’t work as well as you’d anticipated, while others are working even better than expected. Track your data In addition to the analytics within each social network (see Step 2), you can use  UTM parameters  to track social visitors as they move through your website, so you can see exactly which social posts drive the most traffic to your website. Re-evaluate, test, and do it all again Once this data starts coming in, use it to re-evaluate your strategy regularly. You can also use this information to  test different posts, campaigns, and strategies against one another . Constant testing allows you to understand what works and what doesn’t, so you can refine your strategy in real time. Surveys can also be a great way to find out how well your strategy is working. Ask your followers, email list, and website visitors whether you’re meeting their needs and expectations, and what they’d like to see more of. Then make sure to deliver on what they tell you. In the social sphere, things change fast. New networks emerge, while others go through significant demographic shifts. Your business will go through periods of change as well. All of this means that your social media strategy should be a living document that you look at regularly and adjust as needed. Refer to it often to keep you on track, but don’t be afraid to make changes so that it better reflects new goals, tools, or plans. When you update your social strategy, make sure to let everyone on your team know. That way they can all work together to help your business make the most of your social media accounts.

How to come up with startup ideas that are worth your time,https://medium.com/startup-grind/how-to-come-up-with-startup-ideas-that-are-worth-your-time-36cc54b53b5,"How to come up with startup ideas that are worth your time Sign in Get started Founder Stories VC Corner Find a Startup Grind Near You  How to come up with startup ideas that are worth your time Michael Deng Follow Apr 11, 2017     ·       6    min read “Execution is worth more than the idea.” This is a Silicon Valley adage that’s been repeated millions of times. And there’s a valid reason why people repeat it so often. New entrepreneurs often cling zealously to their ideas. In the most extreme cases, they’ll ask you to sign an NDA before telling you what it is. Any “startup expert” would jump at the chance to inform them their idea is worth nothing. But this response is being taken too far. Sure, an idea remains just an idea if it’s not realized. But in the hands of capable people, it morphs into a compelling mission. Venture capitalists often look for mission-driven founders. What does this mean? It means they want to fund entrepreneurs who are passionate about their ideas. This passion will enable them to overcome tremendous hurdles and make others around them care about their mission. “So how do you come up with good startup ideas?” If that’s what you’re wondering in your head, take a step back. Trying to pluck good ideas out of thin air is a wasted effort. Instead, you want to look for problems first. A better question is:  How do you find problems worth solving? 1. Turn off autopilot and be aware of what’s going on around you. Inefficiencies in the world and problems you and your friends face daily are potential opportunities. Most people hit these obstacles, groan internally, and move on. They don’t think about why these obstacles exist and whether they can be solved. Becoming aware is much easier said than done because it requires a fundamental change in being. The way I remember to do this is reminding myself as often as possible. I put “be aware” on my to-do list, calendar, and post-it notes. I also use  Papier  to remind myself every time I open a new tab. But if your schedule is filled to capacity every single day, you won’t have the time or energy to reflect on the world. Always set aside some empty space in your day for you to think about what’s happening around you. 2. Replay your day in your head and think about what problems you faced. Turning off autopilot will help you generate great ideas over time, but what if you want to come up with new ideas right now? One way is to hack the first approach by replaying your day in your head. Think of what you did and the problems you faced as you went about your life. Some of these problems may be valuable business pursuits. Try to revisit unique events. For example, the problems you face while traveling in a foreign country or attending a concert will be very different from those you face in your regular 9–5. 3. Read sci-fi books and watch sci-fi movies. Entrepreneurs like Elon Musk have often credited sci-fi for inspiring them to tackle ambitious ideas. The best sci-fi books and movies capture audacious visions of the future. Some of these visions are a little crazy in their scope, but the current tech world needs some of that lunacy. These days, Silicon Valley is obsessed with small, frivolous things that will make a quick buck. For every company like SpaceX and Magic Leap, there are dozens working on trivial things. I’m not saying things like social networking and messaging aren’t important. If nobody worked on them, we wouldn’t have Facebook and WhatsApp, which connect billions of people. But wouldn’t it be amazing if more people dedicated themselves to scarier problems instead of walking paths tread millions of times before? Read and watch sci-fi, then build yourself a future beyond your wildest dreams. 4. Branch out and try new things. Inspiration strikes at the intersection of different things. Whether it’s taking up a new hobby or traveling to another continent, you expose yourself to more problems and more possible solutions. Scott Kaufman, a psychology researcher, has stated that  “the drive for exploration, in its many forms, may be the single most important personal factor predicting creative achievement.” If you take a look at successful startups today, you’ll find that many of them deal with fields that aren’t tech-based. For example, Stitch Fix solves problems in fashion, ClassPass in fitness, Soylent in food — I can go on and on. A one-trick pony will never be able to make novel connections that lead to new solutions. So go out there and try new things! Trying new things is intrinsically linked to the first approach of turning off autopilot. Deviating from your regular routine jolts your mind out of its default setting. And when your mind is actively making connections, finding problems worth solving is a breeze. 5. Talk to people around you… but not too much. Talking to people doesn’t mean conducting formal interviews or brainstorming sessions. Just be a curious and empathetic friend. Get to know more people on a personal level, learn about their passions, and understand what problems they face in their lives. The more people you talk to, the greater the pool of shared experience and expertise you’ll have access to, which will stimulate your mind to make new connections. Plus, the ultimate goal is to make a product that solves problems for people. Going out there and understanding how different people live their lives is instrumental to realizing that goal. But you should also give yourself alone time to think. Researchers have proven that when you tune out the outside world, your brain improves at making novel connections. 6. Take care of yourself. To succeed at anything in life, you need to be in good physical and mental condition. Coming up with startup problems is no different. Creativity is built on a healthy body and a healthy mind, so don’t mistreat yourself. This is a popular piece of advice, but many entrepreneurs don’t following it. It has something to do with the cult of overwork, where entrepreneurs pride themselves on how many hours they spend on their venture. It’s a twisted way of thinking, but it’s easy to succumb to — especially if many people around you are doing the same thing. Resist the peer pressure. when you’re trying to find and solve problems, quality of time spent matters way more than quantity. Don’t neglect eating well and exercising. Final thoughts There’s no right way to come up with startup ideas. You might find something worth solving in the shower or at the end of an intense brainstorming session. You can’t predict when inspiration will strike, but you can do things to help you generate good ideas. A lot of online startup advice nowadays will tell you not to rush into a startup because the best idea is one that occurs naturally. But this isn’t an excuse for you to be lazy. Be proactive in looking for problems and ideas. Discovering an initial idea is like unearthing a strain of gold. If you’re a miner, would you pat yourself on the back and then move on? No! You want to find out how deep that strain goes. So take your mental pickaxe and keep digging until you collect all the gold. Keep going long enough, you just might find a diamond.

Whether it's a stock investment or your own company's financial records that you're evaluating, the percent sales growth is one of many financial analysis tools used to assess a company's overall strength in the marketplace. In order to calculate the percent sales growth, you'll need current and historical sales revenue information from each company's income statement. Note, however, that sales growth is just one measure of a company's performance – there are other factors to consider as well.             Sales Growth Equation To arrive at the percent sales growth from one financial period to another, you'll first need the ratio's equation so that you know which figures from the income statement to plug in. The equation is: (Current Period Net Sales - Prior Period Net Sales) / Prior Period Net Sales * 100.       Net sales is equal to gross, or total, sales revenue minus discounts, customer returns and allowances for damaged and defective merchandise. Income Statement Information From the income statement of the company you're evaluating sales growth for, plug the relevant net sales figures for the relevant periods into the equation and compute to arrive at the percent sales growth. When reviewing income statements, note that it's common practice for companies to report net sales as just “sales.” Since the percent sales growth equation requires historical financial results, a comparative income statement that reports net sales for the current period, as well as for recent prior periods, is essential. If you're unable to obtain a comparative income statement, it may be necessary to locate the separate income statements for each year. Calculating Percent Growth Suppose you wanted to know what a company's percent sales growth is from its fiscal year ending on Jan. 31, 2017 to the year ending Jan. 31, 2018. In the earlier year, net sales totaled $444 million, but in the next fiscal year, net sales increased to $466 million. Subtracting the prior period from the current one ($466 - 444) results in a $22 million difference. You then divide this difference by prior period net sales ($22 / 444), which equals approximately .05. To express this as a percent, multiply the result by 100 to arrive at a 5 percent sales growth. Things to Consider A single percent sales growth figure has limited usefulness if other relevant factors, such as the industry a company operates in, the sales growth of competitors and even trends of decreasing rates of growth are ignored. For example, one company's 5 percent sales growth may initially seem admirable, but when compared to a competitor's 6 percent growth between the same two fiscal periods, 5 percent may start to seem average. And despite a company's consistent growth, a decrease in the rate of growth over a number of fiscal periods may offer deeper insight into a company's future strength.

 Whenever a new  product  launches in the market, it is difficult for the company or  brand  to forecast where the product will reach or how it will shape up. At such times, brands design the Product  strategy .

 So What is a Product Strategy? 
 You can call a product strategy to be the  vision  of the product. If a company launches a product, then it has a vision of where the product will reach. The product strategy is the bare bone  planning  of the steps to ensure the product reaches the desired space. Such a strategy helps in setting the right direction for the product. 
 Product strategy helps in deciding the basic elements of a product such as its  marketing mix  and its design. At the same time, it also helps in  targeting  the product to the right segment,  product line  stretching etc. All this will be discussed in the steps to develop a product strategy. 
 A common terminology used in product strategy is the product roadmap which means the sequential step of events which need to take place to ensure maximum penetration of the product and maximum  product adoption  in the market. Product strategy helps the formation of the product roadmap. 
 Importance of Product Strategy 
 
 It helps decide the exact steps to be taken in any  event  to make the product a success. 
 It prepares the company for response by competitors or towards changing market conditions. 
 It helps the company decide the  target market  and in  market penetration . 
 A product vision is formed thereby setting the product on an independent path with a time to time intervention allowing the company to focus on multiple  products  in a short time. 
 
 7 Steps to Develop a product strategy – How to develop a product strategy? 
 A lot of product analysis is needed to develop a strategy. Besides product, you need to analyze your competitors, the market and various segments so that you can come up with the right product strategy. Here are the steps of Product Strategy.

 1) Marketing mix 
 The product is the most important element of the marketing mix. If you have decided on a  market segment  to  target , then product design plays a crucial role. This is because a change in the product brings a change in all the other elements of the marketing mix. Be it a service or a product, the marketing mix majorly depends on the product for other aspects like  promotions , place and price. 
 You need to consider the marketing mix while deciding on the product strategy. You also need to consider various aspects of the product such as  product line and length , what would be the  packaging  of the product and what kind of  labelling  will be involved. In essence, the core aspects of the product and its contribution to the marketing mix is decided in this step. 
 Example – While deciding on an electronics product strategy, you need to decide the various product line and length that a single model will have. You also need to decide the packaging and labelling to use besides considering the effect of all these expenses on the marketing mix. 
 2) Levels of a product 
 A product has various levels. One of the articles on this site discusses the three levels of a product which includes the core product, the actual product, and the augmented product. The article also discusses examples of the same so if you want to know the three levels of a product then  click here . 
 A marketer  needs  to assume the various levels of a product while deciding the product strategy. Example – An  automobile  manufacturer or an equipment manufacturer needs to give service along with the product to the end customer. 
 If the manufacturer does not give service, then the product will not sell. Hence at such a time, the manufacturer has to understand the important role of the augmented product in the product strategy. Without the various levels of the product and their proper implementation, the product strategy can fail. 
 3) Type of products 
 The product that you are designing will be of which type? There are various types of products. 4 of these types are discussed in  this article . However, while deciding the product strategy you need to consider what is the type you want to target? Some of them are

  WP QUADS - Quick AdSense Reloaded v.1.8.7 Content AdSense async  
 
  end WP QUADS  
 
 
 Durable products / Nondurable products 
 Shopping  goods  / Specialty goods / Convenience goods 
 Industrial goods/consumer goods 
 Service products 
 
 Deciding on the type of product can help you in determining how to penetrate your target market.  STP  is an important step in strategy but this step will clear your mind on which segment you are going to target because the product is restricted to that segment only. 
  INLINE RELATED POSTS 2/3 // Related:     The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility Explained 4) Differentiation 
 There are various possibilities to  differentiate a product  or to  differentiate services . We have detailed articles on each which you can find by clicking the links above. However, to make it simpler, here are the features which you can use to  differentiate  a product or a service. 
 
 Product Form and Product features 
 Product  performance  levels 
 Reliability / Repairability / Durability 
 Style and Design 
 Ordering ease / Ease of installation 
 Customer service  / Warranties and Guarantee 
 
 As can be seen above, these are critical decision-making elements for any consumer and by creating differentiation at the product level, the product strategy becomes a sound strategy to compete on even grounds with the competitor. 
 Example – American Tourister is known for its durable luggage. The same goes for  Woodland  shoes. These are brands which have targeted product reliability and durability as a differentiating factor right from the product strategy stage. As a result, their complete  marketing strategy  is focused towards one direction – Promoting their products as far superior then competition due to the differentiating factors. 
 
 5) Brand elements 
 Brand identity and  Brand image  are important considerations for the success of any company. Naturally, when deciding on the product strategy, you need to decide the brand elements for the product. There can be numerous branding elements involved thereby giving more recognition for the product and accumulating more respect in the market. 
 Example – Victorinox as a brand has several elements which can help differentiate between the genuine products vs a fake one. It has a spring in its swiss knife which makes a distinct sound thereby confirming that the knife is genuine. Similarly, it has symbols on the top of the knife as well as in smaller tools within the knife to differentiate the genuine from the fake. The symbols are unique too thereby clearly helping the customers pick the right product.

  WP QUADS - Quick AdSense Reloaded v.1.8.7 Content AdSense async  
 
  end WP QUADS  
 
 Such brand elements are important for the recognition and adoption of the product in the market and they need to be created at the product strategy and product design stage itself. 
 6) Product Design 
 Quite simply, a computer is a generic product name whereas desktops & laptops are all variants of a computer. The only difference between laptops and desktops is the product design. Both of them have CPU and both have monitors. Thus, product design plays a crucial role in the success of a product and should be given due consideration while designing the product strategy. 
 The  technology  market is built on product design. This is why smartphones have become a major crowd puller because of their differing aesthetics. If we want to talk about product design, we just cannot ignore the fashion industry which is completely dependent on the design of the product to built its brand identity. Fashion labels like  Gucci ,  Armani  and others spend a fortune getting the design right. 
  INLINE RELATED POSTS 3/3 // Related:     Marketing vs Selling Here is an article on  Product design  and its influence on the marketing of a product. 
 
 7) Product Mix 
 Sometimes a single product might not make the cut but its product variant might be an instant hit. Take shampoos for example. Most in  demand  shampoo are the Anti-dandruff shampoo. However, besides this, most of the top shampoo brands have a variety of products on offer with minor differences in ingredients. These are nothing but a combination of the product mix. 
 This article explains best what  Product mix  is and how to analyze it. Various concepts are explained such as the product line length, product line width, product line depth, product line consistency etc. 
  WP QUADS Content Ad Plugin v. 1.8.7  
 
  WP QUADS - Quick AdSense Reloaded v.1.8.7 Content AdSense async  
 
  end WP QUADS  
 
 In essence, to cater to all the various types of customers out there, a company can come up with a complete product mix so that each customer is satisfied with different variants of the same product. Because a huge market share is covered with almost the same product, product mix needs to be considered strongly in the product strategy stage. 
 When all this information is in hand, then the timeline matters. At the launch of the product, you need your marketing mix in place. Once you notice the rise of the product, you can decide on the type of product mix you want to introduce in the market to encourage further purchases and to improve brand equity of the product. 
 As said before, a product strategy helps you prepare for the future of the product and to give the right targeted direction to the product. When you have a combination of multiple products and various product mix’s, the product strategy becomes very critical to make sense and to have the right tactics up your sleeve for each product.

The All-in-One Startup Funding Guide,https://medium.com/startup-grind/the-startup-funding-guide-pitch-deck-term-sheets-investors-equity-crowdfunding-a212ba9cdab7,"The All-in-One Startup Funding Guide - Startup Grind - Medium Sign in Get started Founder Stories VC Corner Find a Startup Grind Near You  The All-in-One Startup Funding Guide Pitch Deck, Term Sheets, Investors & Equity Crowdfunding Chance Barnett Follow Sep 7, 2016     ·       8    min read There is a proven process to successfully raising startup funding. I’ve learned about the process over the years by getting to know a few of the worlds most successful serial entrepreneurs, by raising millions myself from angels & VCs, by investing as an angel, and as CEO of the VC fund + equity investment platform  Crowdfunder.com . Across all this investment and fundraising activity, I’ve seen that the most successful fundraises have a several key elements in common. Below are five parts to successful fundraising for your startup — with specific examples, templates, and resources. The Pitch Deck Every great startup begins with an idea. And even with the best startups, over time that idea is deeply refined. Creating your Pitch Deck is one of the best processes for getting your idea and business out of your head, on paper, and to enable continual questioning and refinement of your thinking and approach. I wrote a dedicated post on how to create  The Ultimate Pitch Deck . Read through this as you’re putting your deck together and use the template and examples there. And for now here are the high level takeaways on pitch decks: Follow the formula investors look for, which I show you in my post Investors don’t write checks for decks — the goal is to get a meeting/call Go deep on your “meta” narrative — why this, why now, why you, how Give basic product/traction points but less information, more story To help you with your deck, I created a template for you along with examples and resources of successfully funded startups and their pitch decks — it’s all in the  pitch deck  post. This includes recommendations from VCs like Dave McClure of 500 Startups, along with the actual deck that Reid Hoffman used to pitch and close Greylock when they invested in LinkedIn’s Series B. Also, go see successful fundraising pitch decks live in the wild. For this, I recommend you go to  Crowdfunder  and look at several of the VC-backed companies we have invested in from our Fund and/or who are fundraising online. Some of these companies are fundraising publicly so you can flip through their decks. Term Sheets (What To Offer Investors) I’ve also written a detailed post on  Term Sheets . It includes samples and templates from leading legal firms, VC firms, along with data and resources on how to think about the valuation of your company when you’re fundraising. If you haven’t raised angel or venture capital funding before, there’s likely a lot you don’t know about it from a legal, structural, and process standpoint. The high level fundraising process with investors goes like this: The founder shapes terms of a financing (e.g. $500,000 in priced equity at a $5M pre-money valuation) The founder discusses these with investors, and investors consider and respond A first investor decides they will invest at specific terms (not always at the terms shaped by founder) If founder accepts, this can be formally or informally a “lead investor” (someone credible who priced the round) All the detailed legal documents get created or updated, and the investment is finalized The founder goes out to raise the remainder of the round at same terms from other investors Term sheets are used in this process to help founders and investors come to an initial agreement. Again, I’ve shared some great examples and templates for you in my post on  Term Sheets . After terms are agreed to and the term sheet signed, long form documents are drafted by legal counsel, signed, then money is wired. Build Your Target Investor “Hit List” Every great fundraiser aims high by first finding out who the best companies and investors are in their space, and then learning about them and setting goals to to meet with them and capture their interest and investment. To this end, you want to build a deep and ambitious investor “hit list” for yourself. This is a list on an excel spreadsheet of at least 40–50 active investors — notable angels, VCs, and high net worth people who have created, sold, invested in companies in your space. Great fundraisers do great research to find these investors and are creative and resourceful in the ways they find to contact them directly. Your first step is to search Google for the leading investors in your space/industry. Google “top ____ angels” and “top ____ investors.” As a FinTech company I might search for “top fintech investors” and I would find  this list  in the results which I would add to my hit list. This will help you build up your hit list of 40–50 investors or more across both individual angel investors and VC firms. In your excel spreadsheet write down the names of the investors or firms, and partners in those VC firms, and what city they’re in. Then use the online lists of investors to deepen and flesh out your list info at places like Crunchbase, LinkedIn, Crowdfunder. Also, leverage the success of companies that have come before you and raised money in your space. Search for the names of companies you know have been very successful in related markets to yours, and use these online investment sources and platforms to identify who the investors are who invested in those deals. These are also your target investors. With your hit list in hand, you’re ready for the next step in meeting and pitching investors… Preparing, Meeting, Pitching Investors Getting in front of investors takes several steps in preparation before you can expect to find and reach the right investors, meet with these investors, and close any funding. Successful fundraisers put the following process into place before they go out to investors, to make sure their time is well spent: (Note — I’m not including equity crowdfunding in this section on meeting investors, but I cover that below.) If you don’t have a live product, get as close to a working demo as possible (wireframes, designs, etc.) I’ve seen this be a simply a mock up of an entire app, or screen shots, CAD designs, etc.. Just don’t expect slides on a deck alone to do the trick and trigger interest. Ideas are not what investors fund but detailed product plans, progress, teams, and rollout strategy can be. 1. Get friends & family (or yourself) to  put first money into the company /round. 2.  Bring on an advisor  or two with experience in a related space, expect them to add value & make intros 3.  Structure & timing are critical , and are your friends. Set a specific time frame for your fundraise to include an outreach period, terms period, closing periods. Tell investors exactly what the time frame and process is. Often times I see great fundraising set the timing up as roughly two weeks for outreach & scheduling, four weeks of meetings where they meet with investors and discuss and negotiate terms, and then four weeks of closing to follow where they get everyone in (or not) in a timely manner and with a final close deadline. The more you stick to your timing and your guns here, the more that both you and your investors will respect your time, and the more often investors respond more positively. 4.  Send a short pitch deck  ahead of the meeting, set expectations that you are asking for funding (qualify) 5.  Have an “ask”  and suggested terms for the investment when you meet (see Term Sheet section below) 6.  Plan to hear “No”  from all of your early meetings. Knowing this, go to the lower pressure and less significant investors first. Use these meetings to get feedback and become more comfortable on your pitch. Pay attention to what they question, where they get hung up, what they are excited by, how you did well and where you were weaker. 7.  Expect a lot of No’s and failure.  Everyone fails most of the time at fundraising, until they don’t. 8.  Celebrate the process of getting good investors to say No.  I know this sounds odd, but hear me out. Every successful founder knows how hard fundraising is, myself included. To feel better about myself in the fundraising process, I developed a strange and unusual “ritual” that I took up in order to not feel as deflated at difficult points in the fundraising process. My ritual? I make a point of it to celebrate how many “No’s” I received. I actually look over the long list of all the investors who have passed in one long spreadsheet. Looking at this, I positively acknowledge myself for the hard work, time, and toughness it has taken to get this many meetings and hear this many “No’s.” I also remind myself that this is part of what success looks like — getting in front of lots of great investors while knowing that I will likely hear 15–30 No’s for every one “Yes” early on. Use Equity Crowdfunding To Reach Investors Early stage funding across angel and venture capital is moving online. As little as two to three years ago it was against the law to raise funding for your startup online. But today there are new opportunities and new laws that allow you to raise money online from angels, VCs, and even everyday smaller investors (see my post on  The Disruption of Venture Capital ). In short, new  equity crowdfunding  platforms are aggregating investors and can help you get in front of hundreds or thousands of investors in a short period of time. There are generally two categories of funding platforms — those that help you raise money from high net worth investors (accredited investors and investment firms/VCs), and those that help you raise money from everyday people (non-accredited). My recommendation to any startup founder is this  — first start by raising funding more traditionally offline and aim as high as you can to build great direct investor relationships. Get a strong investor or two in if you can first — as they bring strong follow on interest once you’re on an equity crowdfunding platform. Then…  look to leverage what you’re already doing with an equity crowdfunding platform that works with high net worth investors first (accrediteds). Reason being, you won’t have to spend much in the way of added cost, time, or legal resources to put your company out to accredited investors (meanwhile, with non-accredited investor platforms it is a longer and more complex and expensive process). The leading platforms for angels, VCs, and high net worth investors in terms of their size ($ raised online) include  Crowdfunder , CircleUp, and Angellist. Best of luck with your fundraising.

3 Unique Ways to Increase Your Network and Generate More Leads,https://medium.com/@joe_fairless/3-unique-ways-to-increase-your-network-and-generate-more-leads-7f0d6cadee97,"3 Unique Ways to Increase Your Network and Generate More Leads Become a member Sign in Get started 3 Unique Ways to Increase Your Network and Generate More Leads Joe Fairless Follow Oct 25, 2016     ·       5    min read Do you struggle generating leads? Is direct mail or other standard lead sources providing you with a sub-optimal conversion rate? It is likely that your lead problem is more of a secondary symptom and not the true cause. Guy Gimenez, an investor that has completed more than 50 flips and whose current focus is on wholesaling and retailing, initially faced the same dilemma. However, once he realized that he didn’t have a lead problem, rather a relationship problem, his business skyrocketed. In  our recent conversation , Guy provided 3 practical ways to increase your network, and in turn, your real estate business: (1) Google Adwords and SEO, (2) Meet-up Groups (3) Anywhere you go. Lead Generation Technique #1 — Google Adwords and SEO Guy obtains the majority of his leads online via Google Adwords, SEO, and other pay-for-click services. However, marketing in general, and especially online marketing, is outside of his wheelhouse. Guy understands marketing is one of his many weaknesses, which is why he works with those who can fulfill those weaknesses. He found such an individual at a meet-up he started (more on the meet-up later). Guy met a millennial that worked for a major company in town and like many in the millennial generation, this gentleman had a knack for online marketing. Guy realized that marketing is the engine that runs the business. Yet, it is something he is weak at. He doesn’t want to take the time to learn it, so he leverages other people’s time and talent to handle aspects of the business, like marketing, and then they share in the profits. As a result, Guy has partnered with the marketing millennial, who handles all the back end marketing — SEO, Google Adwords, and all the pay-for-click. He brings in the leads into the company website and then Guy takes everything from there. Lead Generation Technique #2 — Meet-up Group Once Guy realized the importance of relationships in generating leads, he decided to start a meet-up group. As a result, he has gotten many deals and formed many great relationships that would not have existed if it wasn’t for the meet-up group. Guy started the meet-up group a little over 2 years ago. He held first meeting at his church because that is the only location he could think of. Going into the meeting, Guy didn’t even know if anyone would show up. Fortunately, 8 people ended up attending the first meeting. His initial intentions for starting the meet-up were not to act like he was a guru. Rather, he was just someone that was looking to build relationships that would be beneficial to both parties. At the time, Guy had cash reserves, as well as real estate experience and knowledge. On the other hand, many investors that attend meet-ups lack the funds and proficiency. Therefore, Guy figured that the meet-up was the ideal way to help others earn money while they learned the ins-and-outs of investing. In return, he has been able to increase his network, get great deals, and find individuals to hire on his team, which include the marketing millennial. Flashing forward to today, and due to Guy’s authentic, benevolent approach, the meet-up has grown to over 500 members, ranging from 20 to 80 members in attendance per meeting. For those that are ready to take on the challenge of starting their own meet-up, simply replicate Guy’s meet-up structure: Pre-meeting, Guy will advertise the meet-up for a few weeks. His advertising approach is three-fold: (1) Put something on Facebook and then boost the post, (2) attend other local meet-ups in the area and convey what his meet-up is all about (3) create an event on Meetup.com. The advertisement is fairly simple. Guy brings in different speakers each week so it consists of the speaker, what the speaker will talk about, as well as time (7pm to 9pm) and location. The meet-up is hosted at a local restaurant banquet room. Due to the late meeting time, it typically begins with everyone ordering dinner. The meeting officially commences with Guy going over some housekeeping items (i.e. reminder to pay for your meals, overview of meeting structure, introduction of speaker) Next, the guest speaker presents, which is immediately followed up a Q&A session. Following the Q&A, those in attendance have the opportunity to either (1) promote a deal they have (2) explain any “need” they have (i.e. what they are looking for, like a flip in a certain zip code, advice on how to run the numbers, etc.) Finally, Guy provides the attendees, specifically the newer investors, with an opportunity to tell a success story. Also, he asks more experienced investors to talk about a recent failure. Lead Generation Technique #3 — Anywhere you go While the first two methods were more specific, this final one is more of a high level approach, but powerful nonetheless. Guy has the ability to form relationships anywhere he goes. And I mean ANYWHERE — walking down the street, restaurants, the grocery store, etc. Guy finds that so much of the population is frustrated. They hate their jobs, they hate their life, and are very apathetic. Therefore, it is amazing what you can do by touching one person everyday with something as simple as providing a compliment or telling a cheesy joke. You may not change their life forever, but you may change their minute, their hour, or their day. By doing so, you can absolutely build relationships and even find deals! One such example occurred when Guy was standing in line at the grocery store. When he got to the register, he said to the cashier, “that is a very pretty dress. I have the same one at home but didn’t wear it because I forgot to shave my legs today.” She laughed and asked what Guy did for a living. He explained that he is a real estate investor, gave her his card, and went on his merry way. Within 1 hour, Guy received a phone call. It was the cashier. She explained that her mother was losing the house, that they already had a foreclosure date, and asked if there was anything Guy could do to help. All the stars were aligned on this one — Guy met her at the right time, the cashier had the knowledge of her mom’s situation, and the mom was actually relaying the situation to her daughter. As a result, Guy was eventually able to stop the foreclosure, get the house under contract, sold the property, and made a nice profit. But just as important, he solved a problem and took that 800-pound gorilla off of their back. That cashier and her mom will never forget it. Therefore, it was the ultimate win-win scenario. However, what Guy did for her is he does for everyone. He simply solves problems and makes a profit in doing so. How many people do you know, including yourself, who reach out to strangers on a daily basis? No matter where you go, there is always an opportunity to touch someone’s life. And maybe, just maybe, they will touch yours as well.

The Basics of Customer Development for New Entrepreneurs,https://medium.com/get-greenlit/the-basics-of-customer-development-for-new-entrepreneurs-5647f0ca37ff,"The Basics of Customer Development for New Entrepreneurs Sign in Get started Young Entrepreneur Legal Lean Startup Leadership Crowdfunding Investment Customer Success The Basics of Customer Development for New Entrepreneurs WeGreenlight Follow Mar 21, 2016     ·       6    min read So you have an idea, a product, or a vision — you may even have some users or customers, and you have committed to making your idea come to life. That officially makes you an entrepreneur, which means your day to day life just got both  easier  and  harder . The easy part is that you suddenly have access to feedback (data) from real,  live  people — your audience. They are right there, ready to give you feedback, and even inspiration. The complicated part is that there can be an overwhelming amount of information, and it’s not always easy to know what to make of it. At the heart of this challenge is  something that great product managers do , they bridge the gap between internal teams and the market out there that wants (or might want) what you’re building. Which leads us to something called customer development — many entrepreneurs and product managers put their own spin on it, but the bottom line is that it’s about developing a relationship with customers and in the process creating a continuous loop of feedback to help inform how the product or company grows. The basics include putting together a strategy to get customer feedback, both qualitative and quantitative (stories! analytics!), a framework to analyze and interpret that information, and and a process for regularly taking action so your idea can go from a cool thing to a complete product. Here are a few key ways to get that customer development loop started… Prepare yourself for feedback (negative and positive) Finding the right customers Reaching out to potential customers Once you find customers, collect data Analyzing and using information Prepare Yourself For Feedback (Negative  and  Positive) One of the very first things that a new business has to learn to do is watch their customers closely, and without judgment. Ryan Carson, the CEO of Treehouse, an online technology education platform, wrote a post a few years ago about  just how painful it can be to get face-to-face feedback from a customer . He watched in-person as one of his customers attempted to sign onto their website. It was a brutal experience because in the process he realized that his own website’s onboarding process was extremely difficult, which was a significant problem for a company that actually teaches web development skills. If you get the chance to “watch” your customers (whether that’s looking at how people drop off during an online signup, or in-person) you need to be prepared for similarly painful experiences. Never take it personally — this sort of feedback is golden — it will help you improve your product more quickly than just about anything else can, and experienced founders welcome it with open arms. Finding the Right Customers Every business is different, so there isn’t one “place” you can go look to find the right customers. At the very beginning don’t worry about the perfect fit — instead, start by finding  any  customers to begin the process. Most entrepreneurs start with their friends and family — the people who know them best and are willing to give honest feedback. Most importantly, don’t be afraid to  get detailed, in-depth feedback from a variety of customers and potential customers . Once you work through that process you can then begin to build a customer profile so that you understand what type of people need / want your product. Focus more on interests and psychographics (people who see themselves as DIYers, early technology adopters) and less on demographics like age and gender. By understanding your customer profile you’ll have a better idea where they spend time online and in real life, and have an easier time reaching them. That does not mean that you should create such a tight profile that you overlook other customer-types. Keep your eyes and ears open at all time as you search for the right customers. Often, the challenge is to simply start getting information that you can sift through, and then actually start thinking about and developing multiple profiles for people using your product (you might hear some entrepreneurs or companies refer to this as “separating people into buckets”). Reaching Out To Potential Customers Whatever you do, don’t fall for the idea that you can use the one channel of “social selling” to reach your potential customers. It is much more easy to ignore, or not even see, a message or post on social media than it is an email or, even better, and old fashioned cold call. It’s important to  be conscious of what channels you are using to reach people , and how you are measuring what works and what doesn’t. Again, prepare yourself for rejection because that is part of sales. But you won’t find any customers unless you reach out to a lot of people and are willing to do the hard work to understand what they need and want. Trust that information above all else, because what people are willing to pay for (in money or significant time/attention) is what you’ll be be building your company on. Once you find new customers, don’t be afraid to ask for referrals to people they think will like your product. Word of mouth is the strongest method of gaining new business, especially for a start up. Once You Find Customers, Collect Data Now that you have customers, you can build your feedback loop. The foundation of this loop is listening to them. Of course you will have to ask them the right questions; one example is asking why they are your customer? What pain point is your product solving for them? How could it be better? What pain point does it not solve that they wish it would? You can ask these questions via the phone, online surveys, or email — using whatever medium they are most comfortable with will yield the best results. Second, once you have a significant amount of users / customers, or traffic to your primary site, start correlating analytics to the information you get via direct contact. Are people saying they want what you’re providing, but dropping out during the signup process or when learning to use a new tool / product? That’s critical information that you need to balance. Analyzing and Using Information Any entrepreneur who’s built a company from scratch will tell you that the moment of data overload comes very quickly. No matter how much information you have, it is worthless without knowing how to analyze it. In the early stages of building a company you’ll want to read everything — every single comment and compliment, and every bit of Google Analytics or whatever you are using to understand quantitative data. Categorize the comments, and, if necessary, subcategorize them. You’ll need to look for trends and chart them so that you can watch them over time. Feedback is a continuous loop, not a one time project with a completion date. And because of that you’ll also want to look at  key metrics that focus on the growth of your product . Increases in total revenue or user signups are often less helpful than looking at the underlying reasons for growth.

Do You Really Need Passion to Launch a Startup? The Answer May Surprise You,http://FI.co/posts/22201,"When getting ready to embark on a major endeavor - whether it be personal, professional, or otherwise - passion is frequently touted as a prerequisite quality to have. And while passion for an idea or ideal is generally considered a requirement for launching a startup, is it really as necessary as founders think?

In this syndicated post, Benjamin Chong, a Partner at Right Click Capital and Co-Director of the Sydney Founder Institute, explains why following your passion is an admirable yet misguided notion, and what founders should strive for instead.

The post, ""Is it all about passion?"", originally appeared on Benjamin Chong's Blog and has been republished below with permission.

Passion makes for success. Without passion you’ll fail. If you don’t have passion about what you’re doing, you won’t do it for long. We’ve all heard these catch phrases, and while they sound good, I’ve had a niggling suspicion in the back of my mind that it doesn’t always work that way. I’ve seen salesmen with loads of passion fail in closing deals. I’ve seen actors with passion for their craft fail in getting work. I’ve seen speakers who are passionate about a cause fail to mount cogent arguments.

While I was growing up, my parents sent me to music lessons. Every week, I remember going to my piano teacher’s studio where she’d have me play scales and pieces I had practiced during the week. On weeks where I had slacked off, my teacher would ask if I had practiced. I’d say “yes”, to which she’d reply, “I can hear you haven’t practiced this week”. If, as a kid, you’d asked me whether I was passionate about music, I don’t think my answer would have been a resounding yes, but as the years of practice added up, I got better and better, and while I’m certainly no concert pianist, I now say I’m passionate about music in general, and piano music in particular.

Cal Newport’s book, So Good They Can’t Ignore You, deals with this very topic. He dispels the popular concept that you need to find your passion before you launch your career. Instead, he spells out the importance of following four simple rules that’ll put you on the right trajectory. Each of these rules isn’t revolutionary, but when combined, they make up a sensible and coherent action plan no matter what your career.

The first rule is don’t follow your passion. In this section, Cal strongly argues following your passion is bad advice, especially when you’re passionate about a field you have limited experience with.

In this section, Cal strongly argues following your passion is bad advice, especially when you’re passionate about a field you have limited experience with. The second rule is be so good that they can’t ignore you. Here, Cal puts forward a number of examples of successful individuals who have honed their skills through deliberate practice. He recalls the 10,000 hour rule made famous by Malcolm Gladwell’s book,Outliers, whereby those who are experts in the field, be it music, sport, or business have spent 10,000 hours developing their craft.

The third (slightly cryptic) rule is turn down a promotion. Cal argues it’s important for skilful people to be deliberate about how and where they direct their efforts. Control here is key, as is having the freedom to take little bets in exploring and experimenting with areas of interest. He also stresses the importance of continual improvement noting that so many people stop learning and stretching themselves once they’ve found a comfortable job.

He also stresses the importance of continual improvement noting that so many people stop learning and stretching themselves once they’ve found a comfortable job. The fourth rule is think small, act big. In this section, Cal provides examples of other successful people who have ‘discovered’ their big and challenging missions after they’ve developed a high level of domain knowledge and cultivated rare skills. One of my favourite quotes of this section is “working right trumps funding right work”.

After reading So Good They Can’t Ignore You, I can see parallels in my own life. My passion for music seems to have come about repeated and deliberate (at least on my parents’ part) exposure from a young age. I received ongoing encouragement with provided additional motivation to practice more, becoming more confident and playing (and enjoying) different genres. In other fields, I’m now more motivated to spend time deliberately practicing and developing my skills, applying some of the author’s other rules.

 For employees, ongoing dialogue with their managers is crucial for success in the workplace. According to  research from Leadership IQ , the optimal amount of time employees should spend interacting with their leaders is six hours per week. While this number may seem surprising and even science-fiction for many employees, organizations are increasingly seeing higher productivity rates from their employees after they spend quality time with their managers. In fact, the study found that employees who spend six hours per week with their manager are 29 percent more inspired, 30 percent more engaged, 16 percent more innovative and 15 percent more intrinsically motivated than those who spend only one hour per week.  
 The Performance Gap  
 
  Unfortunately, employees and managers don’t get together as much as they should. From the moment goals are set at the beginning of the year to the time a performance review happens, there is a gap where little formal guidance is given by managers on how to improve performance. This leaves employees on their own, without any external confirmation that they are working on the right things and without any help on how to increase their impact.   
  Increased attention from management is important for employees because business objectives shift over time, so employees need to be given continuous guidance on what is expected from them. The frequency and quality of such meetings is crucial for goal alignment and personal development. If employees don’t get enough chances throughout the year to connect with their managers, how will they ever be sure they are on the right track and use the guidance to further improve?  
 Why the Current Problem Exists   
 
  Often, the meetings between a manager and employee are unstructured because they lack an agenda. Without a list of items to discuss, meetings can become unfocused.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
           Advertisement
           
 
 
  Managers have other responsibilities apart from supervising their employees, so they don’t make performance check-ins a priority. Common issues include: 
 
 Lack of time : Managers are busy, travel often, or have too many direct reports. 
 Forget to have them : Managers don’t schedule performance check-ins, and sometimes they don’t even think they are important. Also, managers with many direct reports might prioritize certain employees over others. 
 Don’t understand value . Managers will often multitask during these meetings, sending the message that the employee is not important and time should be spent on other matters. 
 Lack of training . Managers don’t know how to conduct performance check-ins. They have been promoted to the manager level because of their technical skills rather than their people skills, so they haven’t been trained properly.   
 
  Employees play a role in this as well, and they often fail at having effective conversations with managers about their performance for the following reasons:    
 
 Absence of performance record . Employees don’t keep track of their activities and achievements on an ongoing basis, so when they have a meeting with their manager they are unprepared. 
 They avoid bragging . A modest employee might not tout their accomplishments, so their achievements are not recognized by their manager.  
 Lack of ownership of their careers . Employees are reactive about figuring out ways to improve their performance and fulfill their potential. They expect their managers to always take the lead and provide strong guidance on what needs to be done to hit their goals. This approach works when managers take the lead and engage employees. But when that’s not the case, employee performance suffers.  
 
  What Employees Can Gain Ongoing conversations around performance between an employee and manager are the best way to increase engagement, improve performance, and develop skills for the future. A lack of feedback causes them to disengage and feel unvalued within the company.    Here are a few ways that employees can gain the most out of having regular performance conversations with their managers:  
 
 Make their work visible.  In order for managers to understand what their employees are working on, employees need to make their activities and achievements visible. Ideally, these items would build up from previous meetings so there is continuity in the conversation and so steady progress can happen week after week.  
 Align expectations . Frequent check-ins with their managers enable employees to understand expectations more clearly and confirm that they are focusing on the right tasks. Have business priorities changed? Is there a need to realign and focus on different objectives?   
 Raise issues proactively . Employees need to share the dependencies they are facing. What resources do they need? What are the challenges they are facing that might get in the way of hitting their goals? Employees need to be very clear about how the environment is affecting their goals or the accomplishment of activities.   
 Invite feedback . Employees need to reflect on recent actions and receive input from their managers. Are they accomplishing tasks in a time-efficient manner? Are they prioritizing their work adequately?   
 Get coaching . Employees can struggle to see the big picture like their managers can. They often need an outside in perspective to the work they are doing. What can they be doing differently? What should they start doing or stop doing? Proposing priority actions and focusing on future goals is important for employees to progress their skills. How can they change their behavior so that performance increases? What do they need to do in order to maximize productivity?   
 
   Continuous Performance Management  
  While managers are the ones who coordinate performance reviews, employees are responsible for demanding the ongoing feedback and guidance they need throughout the year. Performance management should include recurring one-on-one meetings between employees and their managers so performance is always aligned to the right business objectives.   
  These meetings are not a one-way street; managers and employees need to collaborate together. It is not the managers’ job to do the work the employees should be doing, but rather to create the right environment that will make employees successful. And it is the employees’ responsibility to proactively share their work and seek valuable feedback.   
  Developing talent is ultimately a combination of a manager’s ability to provide guidance and an employee’s willingness to learn. By rethinking the performance management process to be more employee-driven, forward-looking, and continuous, company leaders can improve performance and develop talent in a way that appeals to all.

What Do Boards Actually Do?,https://bothsidesofthetable.com/what-do-boards-actually-do-9c278e81da5f,"What Do Boards Actually Do?

There’s a lot of mystique about what happens at board meetings and a lot of imagined board-room drama. I read commentary or Twitter or blogs and realize that there are also strongly held convictions that there are these evil VCs who do terrible things to mostly altruistic founders.

The image of boards and of investors vs. founder conflicts has been so at odds with my experiences on dozens of boards over the past 20 years that I thought it was worth sharing what I actually see.

As a starting point the board is intended to have legal and financial responsibilities to a few key constituencies: shareholders, debt holders, creditors, employees, government and major parties with whom the business operates.

In some ways being a board member is like how I’ve heard people describe learning to become a pilot: Many hours of boredom followed by some brief moments of absolute panic and fear. In fact, as one Twitter commenter observed to what do board do, “Often, not much.” That’s true. Executives run the day-to-day so often the board is more involved as a sparring partner at key intervals.

The administrative work we actually do at board meetings?

Agreeing an annual budget

Setting a 409a valuation used to price stock options

Agreeing stock option allocations

Reviewing financial performance

Talking about the organizational structure and where we need to bolster things

Discussing sales & marketing strategies, product launches, technical challenges

Talking about law suits (patents, trademarks, employee disputes)

And so forth

Between board meetings we do calls to discuss performance or major initiatives. Often we are asked to get involved in executive-level recruiting. And of course we help with business development introductions and with fund raising events.

Board work does involve a lot of conflict at moments throughout the company. Sometimes conflict comes because a company isn’t hitting its expected targets and investors vs. executives have different views in the causes or the consequences of under-performance. Sometimes conflict comes because executives want to increase personal compensation and investors aren’t in favor of this. Sometimes it comes because investors believe the company needs more experienced leadership to run the company or more often to help run the company.

But unlike the popular press reporting of this conflict — 80% of the time it is founder-to-founder conflict and not investor-to-founder conflict. The overwhelming majority of conflicts that I’ve seen on boards over the years are a result of the tensions of either:

underperformance of a company in which executives blame the action of each other or specific individuals

founders or senior executives in a company upset that they don’t have the right role, title or compensation

organizational changes in a company initiated by the CEO that leaves somebody in the company being unhappy

different risk expectations founders have with each other: Raise more vs. raise less, engage in M&A vs. fund raise, grow faster with higher burn or cut costs and focus on profitability, etc.

In nearly 20 years of sitting on boards I have seen:

Founders trying to fire other co-founders

Companies revolting against the founder & CEO and asking for the board’s help

Founders physically threatening other co-founders or employees

Substance abuse

Major problems with depression and dysfunction at the executive level

Of course I’m not saying most founders have problems — I’m just pointing out that when you’re involved with scores of companies you see every kind of human behavior. But importantly non-founders who are often major contributors to the success of a company and would be interested to know that it’s not unheard of to see founders

Ask for major top-ups of their personal equity while not having commensurate top-ups for rank-and-file executives

Major squandering of company resources on travel & entertainment that isn’t in support of company goals

Profligate spending with limited regard for future fund raising that causes major dilution when funds are raised at the last minute

I point out the worst that I’ve seen in 20 years for a reason. Boards are not appointed to be founder-friendly lapdogs for the 1–3 founders who start companies and usually own the largest equity positions in the company. Boards are fiduciaries to represent the interest of all shareholders — big and small — and this includes employees who bet with their careers and with reduced pay in order to have equity they hope will be valuable.

To be clear — most founders I’ve ever worked with have been super ethical, very conscientious, not overly greedy and take their personal responsibilities very seriously. I also want to be clear that some investor board members can act like total jerks at times.

I am usually loyal to the founders I’ve backed above all else. I consider myself founder friendly. I will work evenings or weekends to help a founder in need. I prefer to leave the passionate, mission-driven founder in charge for as long as is possible. If the founder has limitations in running a company I will normally try any other option other than removing them from the CEO role. And if I believe they aren’t the best suited person to run the company I will always sit down and walk the founder through why I believe the company might be better suited with somebody else at the helm. I will see if I can get him or her to see this herself.

But in the end — a board’s ultimate loyalty must be to the company and all of its shareholders. The board is there to represent the interests of all shareholders & creditors and to put the interests of the company before their own interests. At times being “founder friendly” can mean protecting many founders from a CEO or it can even mean providing tough guardrails to protect a CEO’s own personal interests from his or her worst instincts. I saw this first hand with a CEO who tried to get into numerous company-betting lawsuits that we knew weren’t in his best interest.

What prompted this post? It has nothing to do with any individual company. I have been meaning to write this for a while as I’ve noticed that much of my board time is involved in trying to be an independent referee for founders who themselves are trying to resolve their own conflicts. Those seldom get reported.

The rise of crowd funding saw the first wave of founders gleeful that they could raise capital without having to deal with terrible VCs. I think we’re far enough into this trend to see that having strong board members — including VCs — is a healthy alternative to party-rounds of crowd funding with no oversight.

Lately I’ve noticed that there is a second wave that many fantasize about a world in which ICOs drive all funding and founders and employees never have to deal with venture capitalists. ICOs certainly have a place in startup financing.

But having a board of directors and having some of those board members be large financial owners in the business with shared corporate governance forces a tension in businesses that I believe is healthy. This is similar to the role that public markets play in helping shape publicly traded companies. At times I’m sure it feels terrible to be a publicly traded company but ultimately I believe the sunshine of publicly reported numbers produces better results. So, too, a healthy and skeptical board.

Never, Ever Compromise: Hiring For Culture Fit
 
 
 
 
 
 
Your company culture is the foundation on which everything you do rests.  Your culture acts as an unwritten set of rules that drives behavior and cohesion across the company.  
 
 
 
Cohesive, insular cultures are more resilient and can withstand shocks to it (e.g. pivoting multiple times) as well as can be extremely motivational / draw out the best in people (e.g. engineers at Palintir sleeping under their desks in their belief they are helping national security, the emergence of Google's "" don't be evil "" doctrine). 
 
 Bad Culture Fits Lead To Pain 
Most companies do a poor job of enforcing a common culture or are willing to sacrifice the cultural aspects of who they hire in order to ""get someone effective"" or ""to fill a need"".  This typically backfires in a big way over the short to medium term.  Every single founder I know who has compromised on culture fit has regretted it due to the disruptions it has caused their company ( having to fire the bad fits , creating a crappy work environment, good people quitting, trust eroding between co-workers, product moving in the wrong direction, bad actors building power bases, misaligned incentives emerging in the organization, etc.) 
 
Note: for the purpose of this post, I  define  "" values "" in its broadest sense (e.g. included are things like pragmatism,  get-shit-done-edness , etc.) 
 
 How To Build A Strong Culture 
 
 Have strong hiring filters in place.    Explicitly filter for people with common outlooks and values early. 
 Hire lots of relatively inexperienced people as you scale.   You can indoctrinate people who grow up in your culture more easily then people who grew up in someone else's company culture (especially when experienced folks come in the door with negative cultural baggage). 
 Constantly emphasize values day to day.   Be repetitious until you are blue in the face.  The second you are really sick of saying the same thing over and over you will find people have started repeating it back to you. 
 Reward people based on performance & culture fit .  People should be rewarded (promotions, financially, etc.) on both productivity and culture. 
 Get rid of bad culture fits quickly .   Fire bad culture fits  even faster then you fire low performers. 
 
This post focuses on (1) above - hiring filters you can use to find great culture fits. 
 
 Hiring For Culture Fit 
For an early stage, raw startup, your  hiring focus  should be on homogeneity.  You should be encouraging a diversity of origins (gender, ethnicity, etc.) while discouraging a diversity in company values.    Max Levchin  put it on  Quora  ""Having a highly homogeneous (background, education, values, preferences, etc) very early team is better than not -- cuts down on time-wasting arguments."" 
 
An early stage company is a fragile and having people pulling in different directions, or wasting time in pointless philosophical arguments, can be lethal.  Early on, you want to hire people with common perspectives and goals who are all pulling in the same direction.  (Note: this does not mean want you want clones or group think). 
 
 1. Determine the sort of people you want to hire. 
Many culture evolve organically based on the  first few hires  you make.  As company founders, you should actively shape this.  Ask yourselves the following questions, and get agreement amongst the founders: 
 a. What are the key cornerstones of your company's culture?   What sort of values do you want people you hire to have?  
 b. What are you willing to compromise on?   What are you not? (Note: if you are willing to compromise on it, it is not important to you). 
 c. How do you plan to screen for people with these values in your interviews?   What questions do you plan to ask at each stage to surface their values? 
 d. Are there common backgrounds or resume signals you want to use as filters?   (e.g. ""built cool stuff on the side in college"" (Facebook) versus ""ivy league education, double major, and 4.0 GPA"" (Google)). 
 
 2. Ask culturally relevant questions often and early in your hiring process. 
For phone screens at Mixer Labs/GeoAPI (the company I started that  Twitter acquired ), I would ask candidates 2 basic types of questions before passing them on for an engineering interview: 
 a. Basic technical competency questions. 
 b. Culture fit questions. 
 
 My questions were focused on things like the person's productivity, motivations, aspirations, accomplishments (e.g. what they were most proud of, had uniquely pulled off, etc.), analytical approach, design sense, and working style (are they structured?  etc.).  I would also ask for an explicit view on cultural traits they valued. 
 In the background, I would look for red flags in the person's personality, working style, and motivations that would come up in the conversation.  Some red flags for me: 
 
 People whose primary motivation was cash.   For Mixer Labs, we wanted people motivated by the impact they could have (and rewarded people richly with equity).  Cash focused people may make bad decisions when trading off financial decisions versus other stuff (see e.g. parts of the banking industry).     
 People who were smart, but not as smart as they thought they were .  E.g. if asked a simple brain teaser, the smartest people wrote down the question and worked through it.  The people who thought they were smartest would try to do it in their heads and get it wrong. 
 People who would create a bad environment  for the early team (low energy or negative outlook, needlessly argumentative, focused on philosophy over pragmatism, etc.). 
 People no one wanted to spend time with .  This is known as the ""airport test"".  E.g. if you were on a business trip with the person and the plane was delayed - would you be happy to hang out with them at the airport?  If not, why do you want to have them in your office every day? 
 
 
If people seemed technically great but a bad fit culturally, we would ding them immediately. 
 
 3. Ask the interviewers for their view of the person from a culture fit perspective. 
When assessing the candidate after an interview, we would ask people on our team to weigh in on the culture fit of the candidate, and whether people would want to work with them.  This served two implicit purposes: 
 a. To screen the candidate for culture fit 
 b. To re-emphasize cultural values to the broader team 
 
You should be explicit about the type of culture you are trying to build and the type of people you want to hire.  By ""explicit"", I dont mean having a sign pasted up in a 5 person startup with a list of your values.  Rather, I mean make the hiring huddles an opportunity to re-emphasize to everyone on the team what is important to the company culturally. 
 
This constant re-emphasis of cultural values is key as the company starts to scale rapidly and grow (future blog post on this coming - see also example below under (4)). 
 
 4. Take people out for a ""beer"" test as part of interviews. 
We would take every candidate to some social outing (typically dinner or beer after work).  In a startup, people work long hours and you want to make sure people fit in and the team and create an even awesomer [1] environment. 
 
 Intriguingly, in a ""social"" environment, the candidate would often show more of their ""true colors"".   Especially if beer was involved.  This often happened before any beer was drunken - I think it was just a shift to a more social context from a work one that triggered behavioral changes. 
 
 A great example is a candidate we rejected post beer test, who was one of the strongest engineers technically that we had ever interviewed.  However, once we made it to the bar he made a lot of really bad off-color jokes that crossed the line and made the team uncomfortable about him. 
 
When we told our then 2-person team we were going to reject the candidate (who would have increased productivity by 50% single handedly!), one of our employees literally said ""wow, you really are serious about trying to build a big company"".  He saw that we were willing to trade off a great engineer in a competitive environment for maintaining the right culture for us.  This impacted the way that he approached interviews from that point on.  Our example of trading off short term productivity for the right long term DNA resonated with him and changed his behavior. 
 
 5. Have them work out of your office. 
Another way to see if a candidate is a good fit is have them come  work out of your office for a half day .  In one case, for Mixer Labs, a designer candidate offered to take a week off to work out of our offices to see how we would all work together (we paid her for her time).  This allows you to spend more time with the person in a work-ish environment to see if they are a good fit. 
 
 6. Optimize for the long term. 
Every founder has that moment of temptation.  There is a big hole you want to fill.  You have been looking for the right candidate for too long and can't find them.  Or, even worse, you find someone great for the role, but they seem borderline or outright bad culturally. 
 
The right strategy is to not hire the person.  ""If there is a doubt, there is no doubt"" unfortunately proves itself to be true over and over again.
